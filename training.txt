p247_179|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.)
p293_308|The likelihood is that it will be negative.

p339_186|It separates the men from the boys.
0014_000416|Shall we let barbara in?
p237_321|I never thought it would take this long.
0018_000692|Why should I purchase my own?
p255_301|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
en001_neutral_095|He is hungry for success and I am the same.

p304_309|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
p347_187|I think we're very different.
en001_enthusiastic_385|I can hardly believe it.
p340_109|Another man said, It was horrible.
0012_001288|Today isn't any other day.
p283_332|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p340_038|This is my personal assessment.
p304_388|But let's not go down that road.
0020_001387|But mom I'm not certain about.
p231_373|They were to blame for the first two goals.

0020_000180|Toast from the bread fruit tree.
p310_402|I'm happy to contribute to that.
en001_enthusiastic_110|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p313_060|It is not a standing army.
0017_000940|Both sides were softly curved.
0013_000754|Are you a regular darkey really?
p360_130|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
0013_000161|That's a full grown colt.
p236_382|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p270_429|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p283_344|Cast Away now on general release.
0015_001423|I thought you meant how old are you?
p255_364|Not so, it seems.
p247_241|She was an only child.)
p245_181|But we are not immune to the problem.
0013_000802|This is Jack, the relatives of Tom.
0020_001517|They were children of mine.
en002_angry_141|But the game is still wide open.

0016_001495|Aha what have i we here?
0014_000238|Today isn't an other day.
p277_078|Painful, but only because it's true.
p305_093|You've got it coming Kabul.

0016_000973|I'd just as soon swim your way as others do.
p277_209|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.

p250_238|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p307_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p311_153|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
en006_neutral_209|She was well balanced.

p240_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p234_287|How independent is that ?
p274_447|No further details of expansion plans were given.)
p284_366|Mentally, you have to be tough.

0013_000290|There goes the shawl again!
p281_428|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p244_413|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
0017_001694|Now I understand.

p231_390|It was fit for royalty.
0013_000921|I am a selfish sinner.

p276_265|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p257_266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p313_397|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
p360_402|There is so much at stake.
p255_278|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p311_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.

p301_143|All things are possible if you believe.
p251_206|A deadline is still essential.

0012_001378|It would be a hard choice.
p260_124|I can't even get into the A team.

p283_359|The Premier League has been a huge success.

p294_151|It's like a score in some ways.
p261_242|This is a family club.
p225_282|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
en006_neutral_311|It means an enormous amount.
0016_000917|You cruelty shall cost your life !
p339_242|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p228_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p247_281|They are interior designers and architects.)
0017_000360|A nauseous draught.
p304_076|But, of course, it isn't.
p312_025|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p231_408|I should think so, too.
p364_131|That's why he is a national treasure.
p279_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p303_149|I expected these kind of questions.

p297_157|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p253_343|Yet he left a few days later.
p288_269|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p286_314|The effect was almost magical.
0019_001549|My winding sheet!
p226_266|The warning is timely.
en001_enthusiastic_254|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.

p306_268|Once they go away they won't come back.

p374_249|I get very excited by that.
p363_211|A senior party insider said.
p261_425|Yet the data is compelling.
0011_000029|Rat came and replied on the leaves.
p310_274|It seems to have worked.
p297_347|We certainly hope we have been successful.
en006_enthusiastic_160|I'm interested in interesting work.
p297_074|Subtle it is not.
p316_282|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p343_266|As, indeed, they would be.
en007_enthusiastic_051|It is based on population rather than need.

p245_094|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p245_191|It's like a garage.
0013_000476|this turn goes to the hill.
p306_225|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p265_183|It is a farce.
p288_351|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.

p287_383|They will fight for everything.
p311_186|There will be no change in government.
0015_000691|Enough,you a foolish chatter.
p263_455|However, one has arrived in the post.
0017_000878|And vowed he'd change the pigtail's place.
p227_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p273_323|The woman is basically off her head.
0013_000680|She keeps saying I'm hers.
p236_395|I should think so, too.
p278_263|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
en006_enthusiastic_327|He phoned the number in the brochure.

p269_191|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.

0014_001263|Let it give us a chance, my precious.
p308_079|I was in jail for five years.
0013_001473|how suspicious this fox.
p351_275|This is not a message from ministers.
0020_000907|What am I, I'm a racer, son of god.
p272_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
0017_001563|How they went to the mountains to eat nuts.
p311_048|There are different cultures in different departments.
p248_155|They were later discharged from hospital.
0019_000206|Still you owe it a duty.
p265_203|He seemed to lose his focus.
en006_neutral_316|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p232_129|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p225_094|That's as it should be.
0018_000583|Why should i care though David's lips were twitching?
0019_001619|But the tune isn't his own invention.
p228_348|Everyone was in tears.
p305_032|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
0014_001657|I would scoff at these followers.
p341_310|What are you going to do exactly?
p233_344|His contract was then not renewed.
p277_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p232_410|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p250_469|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
0018_001594|Yes, I miss her.
p233_039|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
0020_001393|And what does it mean?
p250_209|It was a moment of madness.
p229_173|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
en003_angry_052|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p323_129|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
en006_angry_253|But it's a subtle process.
0020_000368|Then sadly it is much farther.
p246_283|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
0018_001425|She is now choosing skirt to wear.
p339_082|I won't let that happen.
p306_078|We must move on.
0013_000781|And I never had a whooping cough why.
p258_406|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p282_342|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p307_349|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p229_142|What will happen then ?
p364_278|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p234_349|We are not interested in dividends.
p313_379|I enjoy the creative process.
0016_000722|And what are doves. And what are doves.
p247_249|Others agreed with this view.)
0016_000420|Tom now let our arrows fly!
p286_340|I didn't have the reply.
p236_338|The game is now open.
en003_angry_290|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p243_398|People have a wish to charge twice.
p341_404|Golf has lost a great character.
p340_164|My brother is not like that.
p240_254|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p335_083|We aim to put them out of business.
p265_117|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p241_268|And Michael was just great.
0016_001206|The eye could not catch them.
p310_233|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p239_033|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
0014_000408|The octopus has eight legs.
p362_391|He can win every week.
p264_475|I'm delighted for Andy.)
0015_000262|I believe you are one of them!
p323_333|She was totally possessed.
p261_470|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p278_071|It was a unanimous decision.
0012_000018|Then sadly it is much farther.
0020_001468|I do not eat bread.
p239_370|It didn't matter who was in their way.
0014_001006|Please invite Tom if there is not requires.
p362_405|I'd never heard anything like it before.
0017_000317|At length they came to a sharp bend.
0019_001291|We have showed his shark tooth.
p299_202|He explained to his audience.
p300_301|He was then replaced by Ross.
p343_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p275_219|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p230_079|By then, he was walking on water.
0017_001132|A fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be!
p255_345|This is a friendly match?
p294_074|This is the real thing now.
p263_278|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p274_406|It's too close to call.)
p295_339|However, that could alter following the latest case.
p256_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p294_267|I would love to travel with it.
p335_115|But it will backfire.
p307_048|I try not to expect anything.
en001_neutral_249|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p264_372|I took my chance.)
0013_001115|Tom could hardly speak for laughing.
0012_001384|Another one, ten thousand dollars.
0011_001485|Suppose I take grandmother a fresh vegetable.
p257_154|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p301_084|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p316_182|It was the same with the Dickens.
0012_000974|Because he was a man with infinite resource and sagacity.
p238_039|And so was a photograph.
p345_194|That's when you hope to take advantage.
0019_001275|Her existence makes him pleasant.
0020_001621|I am a selfish sinner.
0018_001718|The name of the song is called haddocks.
p277_029|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
0018_001591|I make her quite nervy at times.
0013_001704|How do you like you dirty bird!
p261_367|Finally came the moment of truth.
p234_342|We did something about it.
p308_405|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p250_228|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
0016_000808|The squire himself showed perfect.
p339_092|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
p311_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p252_143|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p351_122|We were not going to take that risk.
0013_000681|She'll be feverish after so much thinking.
p244_287|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p254_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p317_093|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
en006_neutral_185|The marshall at the turn was great.
0015_000818|Look out! said Alice.
p294_312|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
p301_166|However, who could have predicted this result?
p341_070|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
en001_neutral_247|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p250_036|It was just appalling luck.
en007_neutral_338|He felt it was the right time.
p277_256|This is a question of Islam.
p360_061|I can't believe she is dead.
p339_110|But it was only a matter of time.
0019_000321|Called out the cloud.
p250_355|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p304_043|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p262_393|Emotions were complex.
p298_315|We couldn't go very fast.
p292_146|I suggest a new plan.
0012_001684|Chapter eighteen, the return journey.
p294_343|There are moments of joy in politics.
p263_249|He has run a hell of a race.
p276_419|Everything has its place and purpose.
p330_061|I find it rather oppressive.
en002_neutral_136|We did what we had to do.
p237_049|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
0015_000120|Our King George is labourers.
p363_210|I wanted to have a go.
p275_353|It is not like us.
p273_200|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
0019_000954|She laughed.
p255_114|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p283_182|I'd love to be like Peter.
p249_345|Eight months later, he was dead.
en001_angry_294|This is a war over our home.
p252_292|His season started this afternoon.
p360_202|I'm really looking forward to that.
p292_335|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p229_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p240_233|The body follows the mind.
p333_169|They tried to give her advice.
p300_313|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p329_065|It was the same old story.
0017_000106|I guess it's a choice feast.
0011_000418|I do not eat bread.
0011_001530|And would spoil my joke.
p292_356|It is time for a new approach.
p299_152|It was then into overtime.
p251_045|I feel pretty good.
p281_381|He has seen the past.
p237_121|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
0014_001711|I am safe back again.
p361_201|This is clearly not abuse.
p341_216|It didn't get any better.
p270_191|Miller was every bit as happy.
p263_070|I was very pleased with them today, though.
0014_001551|All the way to China is home.
0014_000317|At length they came to a sharp bend.
0017_000269|But show me how your map!
0018_000751|Said the American to the Chinese.
p264_408|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.)
p300_110|I am prepared to step down.
p308_263|She said he showed no remorse.
p267_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p293_251|Also, he was flawed.
p232_264|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p304_409|We are not too surprised.
p271_196|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p248_281|He will address the nation this evening.
p264_354|Both watched her win yesterday.)
p312_348|We told them in June.
en006_enthusiastic_151|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p265_244|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
0014_000052|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.
p227_311|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
0018_000814|A half pounds of flour and two ounces suet.
p314_379|There were three boys and two girls.
en001_enthusiastic_227|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
en003_angry_140|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
0014_001669|But show me now your map!
0016_001655|This was the twenty fifth of november, seventeen eighty three.
p306_295|People will make up their own minds.
p273_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318_268|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p313_170|There is a simmering anger out there.
0020_001040|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
p248_275|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p334_079|Maybe that was the whole point.
en001_neutral_143|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p250_199|He was rejected because he had retired.
p259_247|We will reform the welfare state.)
en002_neutral_031|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
en001_angry_351|I have got a wife to feed.
0017_001387|But mom I'm not certain about.
0012_000727|Monster made a deep bow.
0017_000094|They found a cow grazing in a field.
p274_226|William Hague delighted his party.)
en001_neutral_121|It is a delight on every level.
p257_405|No preference emerged.
0015_000940|Both sides were softly curved.
p306_069|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p266_081|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
en001_enthusiastic_159|We have to move forward.
p323_342|Everyone thought they were safe.
0020_001723|Why did I wake up!
en007_neutral_149|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p316_033|It is not for any other purpose.
p264_457|The truth was rather different.)
p272_224|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p264_439|Colin Cameron was excellent.)
p334_279|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p254_221|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p254_069|My mother is a widow.
p295_314|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
0011_001686|One two three, where is your breakfast.
p232_321|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p299_034|This is a totally different order of agreement.
p274_227|We played them off the pitch.)
p351_246|He is under no illusions.
p317_315|They didn't have a care in the world.
0015_001384|Another one, ten thousand dollars.
p312_388|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p351_129|These will take a little time to develop.
p264_235|After the match, do you?)
0018_000435|Suppose I take grandmother a fresh vegetable.
p314_369|It looks like paradise.
p336_251|The family baton is handed on.
p374_255|There is great potential on this river.
0020_000283|They had been named Tom and Jerry.
p323_374|The answer is mayhem.
p259_428|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.)
p248_094|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p233_084|It is not a story.
p312_098|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
0013_001101|Said the American to the Chinese.
p360_179|That's when you hope to take advantage.
0017_000060|That I am a born nurse.
p250_220|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p267_160|Nobody did in those days.
p255_036|We do not expect any surplus.
p314_096|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
en002_enthusiastic_021|I would rather look at him.
p312_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
0014_000473|I am from towel land.
0019_001100|Rabbit gave dog a hurrying up sort of nudge.
p254_329|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p306_238|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p245_114|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
0019_000562|No thank you.
p330_126|It's like a high school play.
p293_076|More than half of the school collapsed.
0016_000192|I have had to grow old.
en007_neutral_164|And so the cycle continues.
p293_297|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p271_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p260_218|It's not before time.
p262_163|It's that sort of night.
0012_001607|who What am I, a racer, son of god.
p278_396|The law would appear to be on our side.
0018_001682|Alice I won't forget it again.
p312_122|This latter suggestion is very important.
p250_189|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p345_271|They've been at it for five hours.
p257_051|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
0016_001379|And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.
p237_137|It's perfectly feasible.
en006_neutral_251|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. 
p232_369|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p246_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p251_221|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p308_196|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p312_203|That, he claimed, was essential.
p317_377|And Rangers think they have problems.
p280_151|Does that put pressure on us ?
p284_265|The system can work.
p260_079|Today she has been released.
p230_172|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p286_322|I must do something about it.
p295_077|He said, My own position is quite simple.
p341_277|That is a mark of what you are.
p293_151|Our policy is clear.
p317_035|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p345_130|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
0016_001528|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!
p351_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
0015_000008|That was his chief thought.
0015_000331|She'll be feverish after so much thinking.
0012_001144|They found a cow grazing in a field.
p232_287|It happens from time to time.
p271_312|The letters are going out today.
p302_072|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p267_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p292_367|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p260_111|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
0019_001697|How Tom and Jerry went to visit mister Sam.
p263_216|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
en003_angry_021|You do not change overnight.
0019_000865|They were going fast, with a light clip.
p248_059|It will take time.
p283_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p276_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
0014_001304|She laughed.
0012_001665|I've just shot a stag.
0017_000218|I'll send for Tom to my boudoir.
0019_001356|Please invite Tom if there is not requires.
en001_neutral_270|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
0016_001618|I'll send for Tom to my boudoir.
p245_302|And he goes with it.
p307_421|His views are hardly surprising.
p281_281|The demand is created by the supply.
p246_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p313_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p226_209|Now, it's all right.
p246_249|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
0012_001278|It says no way! shouted Daisy.
p252_392|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
0011_000356|Andy what's the gyre and to the gimble.
p245_103|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p333_394|If not, he should go home.
p297_320|There are different cultures in different departments.
0020_001238|Now quicker the fiddle went.
0019_000346|I am going back to back home.
p297_061|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
0014_000626|Can your name be more hilarious?
p310_131|David was not either.
p274_316|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.)
p361_050|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p268_135|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p326_312|The other conditions were not specified.
p303_076|It will be very useful for us.
p308_149|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p284_418|It is legally binding.

en002_neutral_131|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p268_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
en001_neutral_367|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p273_300|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p240_211|We'll have to work hard today.
p238_101|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
0020_001689|No, said piggy carelessly.
p248_336|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p297_189|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p274_438|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.)
p333_039|His views are hardly surprising.
p333_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p297_379|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p326_213|After that he became more romantic.
p333_187|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p258_169|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p280_387|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
0018_000010|A nauseous draught.
en006_neutral_246|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
p341_394|Maybe, who knows?
p330_178|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p237_234|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p251_283|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p310_160|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p318_406|It's going to be a new challenge.
0011_001090|In which fox loses a tail and its elder sister finds one.
p278_058|Let's hope that it does.
p316_239|The following year, they asked him again.
p294_207|It will take some time to establish.
0014_001587|An hour out of Guildford town.
p293_104|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
0020_000023|I thought you meant how old are you?
0020_001374|And she caught at the brooch.
p268_128|Their season has been consigned to history.
p300_068|How things have changed since then.
p295_220|The joint bid is still on course.
p316_088|I feel confident about the outcome.
0013_000379|Rat came and replied on the leaves.
p266_345|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p257_155|The weather forecast isn't good.
p241_121|You can spend money on housing.
en002_angry_093|Smoking is also very important.
p304_102|There, you were just a body.
0016_000991|The end of february fourteenth.
p266_195|The service from the other players was super.
p276_268|We will turn the corner.
p311_417|He also called in at another farm.
0020_001580|Toast from the bread fruit tree.
p299_064|How could anyone take issue with that?
0016_001208|it looks much better.
p314_184|There is no way to do this.
p308_256|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
0015_000717|Why has this egg not broken?
p340_093|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p329_280|A formal decision will be announced within months.

p243_176|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p278_078|It's so hard to shift.

p241_164|We have a budget in March.
0011_000255|This was the twenty fifth of november, seventeen eighty three.
0016_000685|But things haven't change yet.
0017_000871|I say neither yea nor nay.
p270_370|But BA said the prediction was premature.
en002_enthusiastic_024|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p298_393|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
0012_000308|Perhaps you think that is a queer title for this chapter.
0015_001285|If not, I shall go no further.
en002_angry_162|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
en003_angry_220|They should not be blamed for it.
0011_001105|A deafening chirruping rent the air.
p251_030|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p336_239|It's a bit like a bereavement.
0016_000709|On the twenty second of last march.
0012_001671|I say I will be emperor.
0015_001262|No thank you.
0012_000922|Ask god to help you.
0016_000586|How rash you are!

p258_184|We want to help them through it.

0020_001351|I'm sure your friends can wait!
0016_001292|Give me your hand or I will cry harder than before.
p340_185|Of course the ending was fantastic.
p231_101|That time is not now, however.
p282_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.

p288_384|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p273_266|There's not much money in cycling.
0015_000475|To catch that bulrush root with my paw!
0018_000503|But we are not high yet.
p249_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p323_229|That period was a struggle.
p254_332|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.

p274_267|I should think so, too.)
0011_000007|I'm as bad as I can be.
en006_angry_263|The championship is different from the other majors.
p305_329|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p347_093|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p240_352|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
0014_000181|First, issue a reward.

p307_333|They've been at it for five hours.
p267_272|The stage was set for a showdown.
0017_000989|No, said piggy carelessly.

p262_048|They had to explain it.
p232_050|They had to explain it.
0019_001120|Tom now let our arrows fly!
0015_000098|Said the witch.
0020_000450|Well anyhow it didn't rain, he said.
p292_276|I'll tell you honestly.
p283_240|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p231_460|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
en002_angry_310|So I liked the challenge.
p294_224|It should be a pretty exciting session.
p287_050|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p249_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
0015_000362|Her shoes were like fishes.
p314_121|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
0015_000478|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!
p269_259|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p288_303|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
0012_000304|How do you like you dirty bird!
p257_366|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
0011_001746|I am going to go back home.
0019_000648|She come back to the valley.
0017_000718|Then sadly it is much farther.
p263_471|That should get their attention.
p264_086|Because I was a very physical person.)
en001_neutral_137|Government will intervene.
p277_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
0016_000018|Then sadly it is much farther.
0013_000491|Can I lodge here tonight?
p345_274|And they still have the final to come.
p341_293|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p243_025|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
0017_000634|Chapter eighteen, the return journey.
0016_000674|And she caught at the brooch.
0013_001627|Born once every one hundred years, dies in flames!
0013_001674|Because he was a man with infinite resource and sagacity.
p308_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p362_274|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p272_346|As, indeed, they would be.
0017_000441|We expected Tom would jump for joy.
p361_346|It was his own decision.
en007_enthusiastic_132|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
en001_angry_272|Yet, it worked.
0018_000658|Perhaps you think that is a queer title for this chapter.
p245_155|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p329_313|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
0018_001186|She has eaten the tapioca all of it.
p317_348|I am awaiting a reply.
p345_392|It was a game we had to win.
0018_000673|Why did I wake up!
p227_061|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
0013_001649|You may imagine how I gape.
en002_neutral_333|Some young girls also came by last night.
p233_137|I am now unemployed.
0019_000680|She keeps saying I'm hers.
p270_193|They were seriously after him.
p245_285|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p287_360|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
en006_enthusiastic_161|It had been in place since last July.
p317_298|Was all this really just five months ago?
p259_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
0020_000643|He is old fashioned but he is the best of men.
p340_194|I would be interested in another attempt.
0012_001385|But things haven't change yet.
p259_079|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.)
p275_220|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p278_107|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
0015_000222|Ask god to help you.
p336_194|Where do you think she is going?
p351_284|The rest, of course, is history.
0011_000775|I'd far rather go without them than eat them!
0018_001252|that sounds good.
p374_150|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p317_244|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p252_122|Consumers will also benefit.
0017_000068|I do not eat bread.
p259_427|There was an element of frustration.)
p335_202|I looked forward to it.
p347_406|I believe in God.
0014_000057|Hannibal come to see you.
en001_enthusiastic_153|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p287_192|I can't play the game for them.
p246_218|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p345_210|But it is looking very positive.
p247_056|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.)
p299_244|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
0015_001179|A large flat ferry boat was moored beside it.
0019_000560|It weighs seven point five kilogram.
en003_angry_039|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
0011_000239|This is the way that snakes always talk.
en006_enthusiastic_371|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p237_233|I'd never seen a play about me.
0018_000039|Our thanks to God's oath.
p308_107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p363_104|It's somewhere in between.
p374_263|Is this accurate?
en001_angry_305|Craig is a major concern for us.
en001_neutral_071|The script was funny.
p247_338|It was an achievement all right.)
0011_001096|They'd never know I'd regular ran away.
p226_346|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p329_162|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
en006_angry_195|People acted too quickly.
0020_000415|Tom could hardly speak for laughing.
p351_314|There is good quality.
p236_132|They could use a boost.
0012_000057|Hannibal come to see you.
0012_000424|Come on my jack in the boxes!
0019_001273|Pick, pick, pick!
0012_000787|A hippo lives in the zoo.
p302_184|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p277_177|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p343_086|Both sides have been hit by injury.
en006_angry_056|There could be a way back.
p227_399|How do you take them away ?
p311_343|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
0014_001070|At the roots of a bush of a grass.
p268_357|William Hague delighted his party.
0019_001726|They are made of wood.
p304_225|I see no reason for them to be.
p306_189|It was located on the remote control.
0019_001442|She may mind ye of her.
p297_138|It was better than a soap opera.
0012_001394|Lucy, a clever farmer.
0015_001102|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.
p234_092|They have a further report to make in March.
p281_112|The whole thing is the music.
p234_326|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p345_308|I can't say anything about any figure.
p310_252|They were on holiday in Egypt.
en002_neutral_244|He was just like a godfather to it.
p226_079|Neither it is.
p245_344|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p295_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p326_371|That's always the case, isn't it?
p249_208|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
p330_391|He was located after going to Singapore.
0013_000181|First, issue a reward.
p288_398|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
en006_angry_191|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p295_054|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p305_133|You can never have enough money.
p264_228|He talks too much.)
p234_253|It was just another play.
p262_294|Well, he can do it.
0020_001397|What are you waiting for? man.
0017_001154|Here am i whom you seek.
p227_088|We will deal with the refugees.
p361_042|That means an extra two years.
p300_174|It was a bit like having children.
0012_001325|You shouldn't have pricked him with your horn.
p347_175|It is a job creation scheme.
p264_141|That comes at a cost.)
p341_239|I lost it at the final whistle.
p292_337|To begin with it looks good.
0020_001218|I said you looked like an egg, sir.
0011_000319|How could I dig burrows with short toe nails?
0019_001276|And the next day. Nurse will be released.
p288_165|Nobody did in those days.
p339_164|It would be very dangerous.
p241_255|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
0011_001274|Do you know the lid opens?
en007_enthusiastic_378|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
p256_147|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p292_124|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p364_160|He has gone back to school.
0011_001053|That I owe my thanks to you.
p226_133|She really suffered for her art.
0014_001649|You may imagine how I gape.
p297_094|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p305_215|Every game against New Zealand is.
p335_390|It's really nothing new.
0016_001475|I'd far go without them than eat them!
p241_130|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p236_054|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
0013_001639|This is the way that snakes always talk.
p341_357|This is normal for him now.
0020_000042|She may mind ye of her.
en003_angry_381|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p252_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p299_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343_278|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p345_254|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
0011_000697|What are you waiting for? man.
p287_190|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
0015_001203|But we are not high yet.
0011_001713|Give me a fine fat goose.
p293_387|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p297_378|They finished second and third.
p282_095|Yet, it worked.
p253_311|You may have a short memory.
0017_000007|I'm as bad as I can be.
p239_117|Those people must be accountable.
en007_neutral_351|This operation will change her life.
p313_185|The United Nations must act.
p347_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
en002_enthusiastic_006|However, this idea is never developed.
p250_440|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p231_100|No, the equipment is extra.
0020_001714|Bob goes to a new school.
0014_000219|But the tune isn't his own invention.
0014_000333|You gain for nothing girl!
0011_000153|But we are not high yet.
p330_133|We are now in a safe place.
p234_235|The conference is the first test.
0015_001524|You know, answers to the name of Tom's son.
0020_000079|All my gum tips gone as well.
p286_429|I never had a childhood.
p267_037|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p278_183|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
0013_000083|Be off now as quick as you may!
0018_000006|Andy what's the gyre and to gimble.
0017_000259|The song is called Ways and Means.
0017_000541|I make her quite nervous at times.
p307_396|It was early morning.
p295_252|What kind of festival is proposed?
p265_084|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p234_282|My view has always been the same.
p330_271|For this government, reform and resources go together.
p305_374|This must have been severe.
0020_001571|I say neither yea nor nay.
p249_339|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p236_215|Tommy is not a problem.
p276_374|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p310_356|But he is frustrated at every turn.
0015_000336|Over them swooped the eagles.
en001_enthusiastic_222|My wife and family are the support system.
p248_262|That is highly unfair.
p311_323|It will make a huge difference.
p286_406|The choice is strictly personal.
p326_200|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p271_094|He was possessed
p374_210|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
en001_neutral_181|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p288_127|The goals were good.
p241_216|I was so nervous.
p250_117|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p361_162|This means a lot of hard decisions.
p343_206|I was influenced by all of these things.
p275_340|This is a friendly match?
0015_001629|The first year they sowed rye.
en006_angry_193|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
en002_neutral_064|It is a job creation scheme.
0017_000812|Clown, to call him joey.
p268_058|It was just too much for us.
0020_000925|Her existence makes him pleasant.
0017_000167|I toy with my liqueur.
p256_283|The attacker died in the crash.
p316_238|He had a great game.
p233_386|That set the tone.
p294_406|It was very well received.
p286_183|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p253_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p310_185|There was even a joke.
p298_078|We just try to make great records.
p308_122|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p263_151|She died at her home.
0015_000842|Wake now my merry tads!
p253_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
0013_001351|I'm sure your friends can wait!
p334_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p264_142|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.)
p311_171|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
0015_000830|And would spoil my joke.
p248_026|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
0015_001488|In my opinion that-is a good idea!
p300_363|This is not great, but it goes well.
p317_160|How can you not react?
en002_enthusiastic_176|People should not become complacent.
0016_000790|And they did push so!
p228_370|It's a record label, not a form of music.
0020_001735|But things haven't change yet.
0020_000695|A whirring noise was heard.
p256_119|I joined a group.
p275_419|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p250_177|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
0017_000413|Asteroid three hundred and twenty five.
0016_001314|Slam the doors and wedge them!
p285_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p280_366|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
0019_001361|I am safe back again.
p360_064|Most of the works are small in scale.
p374_262|I have not come in to take over.
en002_neutral_169|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p280_298|It is based on population rather than need.
p244_331|What are they for ?
p226_146|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
0012_000947|She and i are running a neck and neck race.
0018_000362|Her shoes were like fishes.
p244_193|Was it the wife ?
p274_134|This is a major championship.)
p232_110|I don't have many friends.
p226_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p347_222|Do not forget about Monaco.
p252_403|Had this been common practice ?
p339_322|You'll have to wait and see.
p286_126|Maybe this battle has been.
p281_353|I think this proposal is excellent.
p362_128|I had never done anything like it before.
p256_189|It is a terrible loss.
en007_neutral_123|At first I thought I was gone.
p231_153|He was asked to quit.
p313_108|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
0015_001012|Father has yellow eyes.
p330_150|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
0014_001555|This speech roused dame ilse to anger.
p280_273|I think I was about four years old.
p240_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p306_131|That group reported just before Christmas.
p285_217|That has been the easy part.
0018_000826|this turn goes to the hill.
0011_000006|Andy what's the gyre and to gimble.
p249_096|Now the system is right behind us.
0019_001415|Poor Tom is now dead!
p256_251|There will be widespread support on all sides.
0018_001078|She had said, so that one could keep up a conversation!
p310_314|Boarding school was equally protective.
0019_000878|And vowed he'd change the pigtail's place.
p339_373|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
en001_neutral_226|It is set in Paris.
0013_001418|Then sadly it is much farther.
p254_264|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p261_393|The pair are very much in love.
en006_neutral_032|Officers recovered a second body in the area.

p260_350|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
0011_001627|Born once every one hundred years, dies in flames!
p311_254|That's my daughter acting.
p297_112|We are just being flooded.
en006_enthusiastic_108|That was our last chance to do something.
p265_263|It's a way of life.
p284_179|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
en002_enthusiastic_099|I fell against him.
p341_118|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
en002_angry_357|The game is now open.
p317_417|The police have to act to help them.
p276_464|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
0016_000320|Goat Billy asked the old chinese guy.
p329_145|This can only help us go forward.
en001_angry_218|I am immensely sad.
0016_000813|Mister lawson saw george last night.
0019_000173|He searched through the box.
p226_232|My wife and family are the support system.
p278_269|We accept the new rules.
p299_195|We've got a great defensive club.
p236_312|It was really very frightening.
0020_001400|Do you have anything in mind?
p264_148|Do I think about them often?)
p228_351|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p360_403|It has great potential.
p264_038|It was a total surprise.)
p279_150|In each case they were a goal down.
0020_000136|She has eaten the tapioca all-of it.
p248_346|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p316_055|But the law is very clear on this.
p313_102|There was no trouble at all.
p254_095|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p259_142|What happened in that game ?)
p336_319|This is a problem we have to tackle.
p374_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p274_435|Its failure is no surprise.)
p292_248|My life has been turned upside down.
p297_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341_378|And it's not funny.
0013_000091|We expected Tom would jump for joy.
en002_neutral_325|It is not just about pay.
en006_enthusiastic_102|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
p286_396|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p310_247|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p257_404|It is simple, but profound.
0016_001309|The song is called Ways and Means.
p274_067|How are you, sir ?)

p246_355|It is a memorial.

en006_neutral_304|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p284_099|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.

p313_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343_072|We could have got three medals.
p339_283|There is nothing to be gained from that.
p276_442|Not many people like to do that.
p361_265|When she returned, it was a wreck.
en006_enthusiastic_393|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p258_060|Try to save us.
0015_000370|At the roots-of a bush of a grass.
p316_048|And they removed a Borderer.
p228_071|The script was funny.
p334_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
0019_000055|A deafening chirruping rent the air.
p270_269|I'd never run for them.
p336_097|This is in a league of its own.
0013_000386|How I hate this foul pool!
p284_165|Again, we were lucky.
p306_283|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.

en002_angry_198|The institute board will take the decision.
p339_087|I am not completely insane.
p259_407|We will win the argument.)
p310_205|They will want to watch a winning team.
p335_227|This is wonderful news.
p263_355|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
0018_000210|It weighs seven point five kilogram.
en007_enthusiastic_306|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
0017_000691|Enough,you a foolish chatter.
0014_001257|What am I, I'm a racer, son of god.
p253_340|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p333_173|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p251_224|It's just a place to open it.
p258_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p347_139|He had reason to be pleased.
0017_000469|The owl flew into a bush.
p311_391|I had to calm down.
p249_201|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p281_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p288_117|There were no grounds for his action.
p351_163|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p311_301|He said he was sorry.
p340_223|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
en001_neutral_105|Oil embargo endorsed.
p294_372|But opponents were quick to criticise.
p227_238|William Hague delighted his party.
en006_enthusiastic_245|They are all bright and different.
0013_000956|I must have two to fetch and carry.
0020_000456|I guess it's a choice feast.
en001_enthusiastic_393|You did not see it.
0014_001335|The straw, charcoal and the pea.
0013_000843|Pussy can sit by the fire and sing.
p239_396|This fact is supported by audience research.
0011_000763|Asteroid three hundred and twenty five.
0012_000288|She has felt shy of it.
0011_000099|I've hit the wrong nose.
p323_140|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p339_032|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p267_105|She's got to say something.
p294_221|The six others were injured.
0019_001186|She has eaten the tapioca all of it.

p276_042|He is married with three children.
en002_enthusiastic_205|It was a good performance.
p310_301|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p313_198|This is a really serious issue.
0016_000444|They found a cow grazing in a field.
p236_036|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p313_256|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p364_130|The timing is wrong.
p249_087|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p281_146|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p299_246|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p347_069|He already had had complaints.
0012_001634|Hurry up, hurry up!
p323_169|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
en003_angry_110|He has been a success this year.
p330_183|Euro The single currency is a fact.
p283_029|Because we do not need it.
p323_297|I've got the shirt.
p259_288|It is probably in the culture.)
p257_149|That group reported just before Christmas.
p283_027|It's not going to work out that way.
p294_309|You could see he was thinking about it.
p374_241|It's always somebody else's.
0015_000784|By hook or by crook.
p256_051|Is a drug dealer?
p236_384|They know it'll be fantastic.
p258_272|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p323_032|Leisure centres were also affected.
p301_039|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p312_056|My only concern is for my children.
p232_196|I came home by ambulance.
0019_001452|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.
0011_000332|where are you going?
p292_336|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p333_366|People buy everything with cash.
0020_000746|They'd never know I'd regular ran away.
p228_121|The picture is the same across Scotland.
0015_000154|He dreamt them all night.
0012_001069|At the end of four.
p301_369|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p271_422|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
0019_000502|Guilty for what do you rule?
0012_000322|A special pot too.
0013_000969|But show me now your map!
p245_228|This fact is supported by audience research.
p269_230|I'd never seen a play about me.
p274_075|Talk of a crisis is absurd.)
p295_025|It has never been worthwhile.
p250_197|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p302_181|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p270_179|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p241_284|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p310_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
0014_000234|Hurry up, hurry up!
en006_angry_109|That would help.
p308_342|I just need a bit of luck.
p256_179|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
0015_000237|What would they do at the end of the year?
0015_001020|Goat Billy asked the old chinese guy.
p351_376|But what lies ahead?
p304_389|It is not attempting to offer a solution.

p233_105|He has become a monster.
0013_000702|I did go, and made many prisoners.
p268_086|He's not getting into any games.
p270_046|I had come back from London.
0012_000856|The eye could not catch them.
p251_087|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
en006_enthusiastic_322|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p233_279|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p333_160|We are not moving in.
0018_001478|The art quite safe with me.

p341_303|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
0013_000657|I owe them five hundred dollars.
p234_183|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p316_400|Well, there you go.
p255_285|This is a national crisis.
p261_261|No production contract is yet in sight.
p273_301|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p360_280|The joint bid is still on course.
p252_330|We want immediate action.
0011_000989|No, said piggy carelessly.
p299_229|I think he has undergone a sea change.
0013_000563|Let it give us a chance, my precious.
p273_241|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p226_057|It's the big omission.
p238_084|He's very young and very keen to do well.
p316_113|I've tried to get on with my life.
p263_420|Such an attack is bizarre.
0014_001135|Suppose I take grandmother a fresh vegetable.
p244_186|The feeling is hard to describe.
0015_001033|You gain for nothing girl!
0011_001383|You gain for nothing girl!
0020_000289|No, said piggy carelessly.
p302_216|A judicial review is also being considered.
p236_311|We can work all night.
p286_180|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p361_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p275_158|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p270_139|Italy was just behind the US.
p259_154|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.)
en001_enthusiastic_372|The salary changes are long overdue.
p257_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p270_411|That is the ultimate revenge.
p226_120|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
en007_enthusiastic_247|They haven't been thought through.
p259_314|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.)
0014_000849|My winding sheet!
p302_282|I see no need for change.
p254_155|The weaknesses are few.
p339_159|The enemy was time.

p240_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p276_235|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p243_161|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p265_079|It will be tight.
p341_145|The road was closed for several hours.
p318_197|They should feel ashamed.
p279_132|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p231_388|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p304_199|That would be unlawful.
p329_127|There is no smoking gun.
p271_290|It was a virus.
0020_000365|Poor Tom now is dead!
p281_271|On the contrary they stand to gain.

0012_000891|I make her quite nervy at times.
p277_055|He is too weak to move.
p278_321|I first met him last summer.
p330_195|The luxury has been well used.
p241_240|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p294_302|Everything is so commercial.
p306_052|It's a grey area.
0015_001401|The nine the eggs, I keep.
p262_036|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p232_345|Indeed, it was magical.
p307_108|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p360_164|It is a new company for Scotland.
p269_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p293_080|Sometimes they come off.
0012_000216|well it isn't picked at all.
p263_265|You can feel at home in China.
0012_000827|Cos I know I had some honey.
p264_100|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)
p226_268|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
0017_000631|He could not help doing so.
p268_102|You should try to have a laugh.
p292_107|That, however, is the end of the good news.
0013_001582|Age forty five if a day a lie.
en006_neutral_232|No-one wanted to run it tonight.

p301_358|We must not go down that road.
p293_256|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p307_147|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p307_272|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p283_428|That is a personal matter.
p364_053|I can live with that.
p252_238|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
0014_000939|This is the way that snakes always talk.
p351_210|If only the problems concerned the players.
p280_378|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
0015_000632|Alice I won't forget it again.
p279_300|I thought it was my only chance.

p266_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
0016_000455|He was killed by an arrow.
0016_000250|Her kind and firm glance.
0011_001257|What am I, I'm a racer, son of god.
0014_000586|How rash you are!
0013_000511|That's a full grown colt.
p255_279|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p347_283|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p280_294|The agreement remains the only show in town.
0020_000988|She has felt shy of it.
p248_230|It's the same as Glasgow.
p311_147|I believe in trade unions.
0017_000558|However, somebody killed something.
0017_000402|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.
p294_038|Their ambition is to go back.
0019_000335|But things haven't change yet.
p347_028|There are moments of silence.
p270_273|Who was she ?
p339_188|He loved it, and so did they.
p300_212|He was too good for me - too consistent.
0018_000586|How rash you are!
en002_enthusiastic_056|The effects are not all bad.
p306_356|No person was charged.
0020_000188|Now quicker the fiddle went.
p246_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341_215|All inquiries should be made to the police.
0017_001469|Not much use is it, sam?
p297_028|Appointments should be made on merit.
en007_enthusiastic_069|Italy was just behind the US.
p364_105|This is a horrible loss.
0015_001503|The elephant and the carpenter is the longest.
p280_348|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p287_267|There's not much money in cycling.
p251_147|That group reported just before Christmas.
en001_angry_232|It's only fair.
p304_306|He is married, with two children.
p310_060|She has a wonderful mind.
p333_066|It sounded awfully like panic.
p306_153|We need some confidence to get a win.
p363_348|The world is being invited to visit.
p243_129|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
0015_001030|She keeps saying I'm hers.
p307_124|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p252_273|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p343_268|We are all suffering.
p268_333|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p241_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p298_182|They just would not have run away.
p303_201|It was a very difficult decision for us.
0018_000795|Aha what we have here?
p246_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
0013_001325|You shouldn't have pricked him with your horn.
p264_071|But I had never been in a theatre.)
p307_371|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p280_349|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p345_054|We will be paying agency rates.
p294_333|Iraq has no interest in war.
p351_341|But he has strong links to Labour.
p292_379|That's not like us at all.
0015_000742|She may mind ye of her.
p225_303|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p285_149|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p300_219|I might get an injury very easily.
p298_129|We have great team spirit.
p227_278|That could be in place by next year.
p281_327|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p341_128|It is crucial for both teams.
p273_144|So what is the campaign about ?
0016_001456|Your midget wife can never sing a song.
p258_179|Four policemen were wounded.
p278_409|The next few months will tell.

p240_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p276_452|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
0016_000112|Clown, to call him joey.
en002_angry_328|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p243_180|I am secure in my own position.
p275_111|It is a financial matter.
p351_084|She was also very brave.
en001_angry_167|It's quite a routine.
p254_319|The police have to act to help them.
p334_192|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p362_133|Labour is providing none of these.
en007_enthusiastic_374|He was overwhelmed by the response.
0012_000052|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.
0018_000247|She and i are running a neck and neck race.
p264_115|That's the bit that's wrong.)
p267_139|It has to be an event.
p274_197|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.)
p265_083|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p299_001|Please call Stella.
0018_000748|You are not a runaway,who are you?
0018_000828|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!
0020_000869|Sam waved his arm vaguely.
p226_083|It works for us.
p301_354|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
0019_001068|Then sadly it is much farther.
p251_107|It had been played at festivals.
p284_309|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p269_162|His death was a tragic accident.
p244_051|In my view, it has to be done.
p363_345|One was taken to hospital.
p304_344|What do we do for an encore?
p312_168|What's it for, after all?
p238_068|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
0015_001597|Fur flew through the air, teeth gnashed.
0017_000177|Tom fell with a cloven head.
p347_218|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p298_330|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p237_088|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
0020_001270|Her paw went into your eye?
p286_358|The pain is still acute.
0012_001620|Her paw went into your eye?
0012_001574|I pay half a crown a week extra.
p284_041|Dancing was her life.

0018_000555|Fear neither root nor sprout!
en006_neutral_363|The damage is all inside.
0014_000988|She has felt shy of it.
p345_066|That is part of athletics.
p301_163|This is a United Kingdom.
en006_enthusiastic_193|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p228_042|No meaningful response was issued.
0016_000782|A fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be!
p283_191|It's nice to be nice.
p261_175|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p263_053|He will need that machine.
p280_305|What happened in that game ?
p340_035|They were appalling, disgraceful.
p273_340|He was at school in Devon.
p318_064|I learned a lot from that.
p281_355|He deserves a top team.
p239_128|How independent is that ?
0013_000923|Pick, pick, pick!
p244_057|Clearly, they had other problems.
0016_000508|it looks much better.
p285_130|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
en001_neutral_388|After the match, do you ?
p273_116|This is a frightening development.
0015_001168|Look out! said Alice.
p284_053|My fitness was very poor.
en001_angry_323|I'd like to take the plunge.
p279_207|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p303_098|She is on a life support machine.
en003_angry_285|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
0016_001256|Still you owe it a duty.
p277_151|So I got a blood test.
p270_444|It shows the right amount of progress.
p363_152|The progress has been steady.
p274_126|Why change it ?)
p267_140|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p351_240|Now he is in charge of this.
p361_049|I am the fastest player on the course.
p345_105|If not, a deal could take many months.
p277_280|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p329_245|We went on to become very successful.
p265_041|A neighbour said.
p271_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p236_090|After the match, do you ?
0013_000940|Both sides were softly curved.
0016_001010|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.
p232_094|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p360_088|They couldn't keep it together.
p330_227|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p273_374|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p333_324|I haven't won the world title.
p360_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p335_303|This looks like it is anything but open.
p240_307|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p343_147|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
0018_000486|She has eaten the tapioca all of it.
p288_251|I told you I was ill.
p232_258|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p303_101|The election is total confusion and chaos.
0016_000546|Clear are your eyes and bright your breath!
p306_081|His options are severely limited.
p271_048|He is too weak to move.
p351_366|We are not asking for the moon.
p313_300|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
en006_neutral_077|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p225_157|He was asked to quit.
p287_382|This remains the party's policy.
p298_342|I get to work with very good people.
p347_085|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p363_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_340|The stadium was full.
en001_enthusiastic_271|It was a virus.
0018_001013|Give me a fine fat goose.
p305_187|It is giving out the wrong message.
p225_126|The squad is too small.
p294_256|This would give Scotland around eight members.
0015_001269|But the tune isn't his own invention.
p307_152|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
0012_001225|All this have we won by our labour.
p284_167|Does that put pressure on us?
p310_259|That could be at least five years away.
p326_370|I'm desperate to play in this match.
en003_angry_041|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
0018_000138|But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
p236_473|They make a selective perception process.
p361_065|I thought it was quite a positive result.
0013_001524|You know, answers to the name of Tom's son.
0012_000855|This speech roused dame ilse to anger.
0020_000148|And on the top of them, came Winnie, the cute bear.
p303_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
en001_neutral_224|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
0013_000422|How are you, dear child?
p234_322|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
en007_enthusiastic_130|I remember that day well.
p258_083|Today I couldn't run on it.
0020_000546|Clear are your eyes and bright your breath!
p310_250|I would urge the Government to think again.

0020_000680|She keeps saying I'm hers.
p234_193|The performance is not there.
p360_338|But this is nonsense.
p232_095|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p361_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p286_371|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p310_162|I hadn't been looking after myself.
0012_001180|And would spoil my joke.
p288_341|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
0018_001734|Another one, ten thousand dollars.

p313_299|The incident is being taken seriously.
0011_000574|Do you know the lid opens?

en006_enthusiastic_337|He added that her comments were noted.
p312_325|This is complete nonsense.

p286_190|His son is a local legend.
en001_neutral_109|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.

p233_082|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p275_368|There is no signature.

p308_231|There is no reason at all.
p258_224|It's so special.
p341_037|This has been blown out of all proportion.
0012_000244|Off for the prison ship.
p249_109|It is a good day for the coalition.
p226_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p273_088|It was clear on Thursday.
0017_000966|We may join with that power.
p261_464|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.

p283_243|I'm just a regular person.
p258_262|They must play for each other.
en007_enthusiastic_292|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p351_369|This was not the show for me.
0017_000817|They were children of mine.
0019_001251|A lady, is on Alice's lap!
0020_000297|How Tom and Jerry went to visit mister Sam.
p360_093|That's what makes it interesting.
p248_127|So the European elections are extremely important.
en006_enthusiastic_129|He had taken everything from me.
0011_001059|On the twenty second of last march.
p256_295|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
p360_332|I don't think he played his best.
p308_304|The snipers are also out.
0020_000251|The ladybug told them proudly.
p313_078|We are confident of taking that back.
p244_116|In the end we have to take a stand.

p245_183|I have a cold.
0012_001364|Bob goes to a new school.
p374_057|It is simple, really.

en007_enthusiastic_220|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
p237_114|I came to complete.
p304_161|I have worked with him on projects.
p263_325|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p341_373|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p225_182|We are just glad to be alive.
p312_313|And they did just that.
p228_084|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
0012_001548|And on the top of them, came Winnie, the cute bear.
p241_079|This is the way things should be handled.
p256_186|They need to look after themselves.
p295_106|This has been a terrible experience.
0014_001400|Do you have anything in mind?
p228_170|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p255_205|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p277_204|A Grampian Police spokesman said.

p227_040|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
0011_000744|Take courage all isn't lost yet.
0015_001000|Six was half way down the room.
0013_000651|I'm sure your friends can wait!
p292_288|However, we had no failures in our side.
p241_280|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p280_103|We were under a bit of pressure.
p310_235|This film will be totally awesome.
p340_249|We've got to get this right.
0020_000826|this turn goes to the hill.
0019_001477|But I saw you walking.
0011_001019|How could I dig burrows with short toe nails?
p314_285|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p297_341|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p374_247|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p364_299|You will be very, very welcome.
p262_377|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p345_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p302_265|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p292_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p257_394|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p248_214|It had all been arranged.
p294_069|It makes for an interesting conference.
p276_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
en003_angry_025|It wasn't to be.
p363_043|His film is not.
p260_353|Eight months later, he was dead.
0019_001056|Andy what's the guy to gimble.
0016_000513|How they went to the mountains to eat nuts.
p340_103|He almost admitted as much.
p312_301|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p362_357|The programme was awful.
0017_000209|A raging fire was in his eyes.
en006_enthusiastic_107|The party lasted all night.
0014_001009|He owed mister Lawson, I can't tell you how.
p364_243|The car driver was not injured.
p334_238|I never wanted a legal battle.
p261_458|Our legal advice is clear.
p360_251|Did he just want to be on telly?
p255_254|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p364_085|He dismissed the action.
p330_185|The election is total confusion and chaos.
0012_001728|It would be a hard choice.
p362_358|It is having a big impact.
p259_371|He was unable to come.)
en003_angry_013|That was the agreement with the manager.
p245_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p351_322|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.

p239_076|The Government does not go far enough.
p364_109|Success in Scotland is important.
p241_279|I saw it at a ruck.
p262_123|It plans to return to this field.
p292_106|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p297_338|That was one very hard game.
p281_139|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
0014_000848|And on the top of them, came Winnie, the cute bear.
en006_angry_156|It was a breathtaking moment.
en002_enthusiastic_284|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
0015_000050|Rabbit gave dog a hurrying up sort of nudge.
0013_000383|This used to be Jerry's occupation.
p306_175|You cannot eat in the dining room.

p326_159|This meeting is the path to salvation.
0012_000228|It says no way! shouted Daisy.

p240_348|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p272_093|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.

p243_230|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p318_072|Before the games it was pretty open.

p243_001|Please call Stella.
p228_057|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.

p284_359|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
0015_001406|Andy what's the guy to the gimble.
0014_001269|But the tune isn't his own invention.
p250_443|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p231_330|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
0020_001136|And tick a tack too.
p280_230|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p277_254|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p334_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p312_106|The Rangers think they have problems.
0017_001528|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!
p243_070|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p326_155|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p240_085|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p374_271|Three months or so later, they are returning.
0015_001580|Toast from the bread fruit tree.

p273_284|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p236_236|I am considered a teenager.
p249_303|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p240_368|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.

en001_angry_207|His third goal was superb.
p247_441|There is no hiding place.)
p295_388|Things were not easy from the outset.
p330_110|The money is not really our concern.
p323_237|He predicted the contest would be very close.
p286_030|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.

p279_076|The end result is precisely the same.
p336_036|I want to make a vigorous defence.

p360_351|The most important thing was to win today.
p275_162|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p313_333|But when we do it is great.
p362_132|I had been hoping for justice.
0014_000860|Kitty, can you play chess?
p271_297|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p249_090|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p374_162|You probably have never seen them before.

p297_409|My heart is not so sure.
p336_145|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.

p277_163|It is so unfair.
en007_enthusiastic_303|He talks too much.
en003_angry_129|His body was never found.
p362_204|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p273_109|He thought she was amazing.
0014_000269|But show me how your map!
0011_000636|One two three, where is your breakfast.
p261_424|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
en001_neutral_147|That group reported just before Christmas.
p230_315|I must do something about it.
p271_126|The people will come.
0011_001077|Monster made a deep bow.
p237_217|He is slightly confused.
p277_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p247_089|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.)
p285_099|No, the equipment is extra.

p259_384|The Allies intend to maintain the average.)
p287_259|It is not enough to be first division champions.

p274_057|He's not getting into any games.)
en002_angry_317|I can't even get into the A team.
p257_301|I never thought it would take this long.
p231_217|He has a lot of skill.
p307_265|He was telling me to keep quiet.
0018_000277|The end part is fish mouth.
p260_312|The letters are going out today.
p260_235|Our policy is clear.
0015_000578|It says no way! shouted Daisy.
p292_238|This is my home town.
en006_neutral_321|We could easily be cut again.
p270_322|Why change it ?
p271_179|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
en007_neutral_097|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p329_173|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p286_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311_390|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p253_071|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p307_049|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
en006_neutral_272|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p305_234|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p335_189|Do you come from Moscow?
p281_243|This is the year of the Tiger.

p262_284|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
0012_001652|I am run off my feet.
0020_000975|You shouldn't have pricked him with your horn.
p252_250|Our focus remains on quality revenue.

0017_001598|I'd shoot myself. a pause.
p345_393|I've never had problems with any football managers.

0011_001327|The end part is fish mouth.
p310_152|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
0013_000438|In my opinion that is a good idea!
p254_199|Today was first class.
p323_274|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p374_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p304_090|They've got their own agenda.
0014_000836|She has eaten the tapioca all of it.
p318_156|If so, we want to hear from them.
0015_000683|You gain for nothing girl!
0020_001628|It says no way! shouted Daisy.
0011_000767|I suppose no, it doesn't!
p248_221|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p264_160|It was clearly not a battle.)
en006_angry_352|This much I can tell you.
0017_000275|You shouldn't have pricked him with your horn.

p306_158|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
en001_angry_213|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p248_112|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p283_465|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
en001_enthusiastic_400|I came into this world with nothing.p237_062|None has ever been found.
p240_181|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.

p351_222|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
p362_395|I never got anything out of it.
0011_000983|They had been named Tom and Jerry.
p306_278|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.

0012_001569|Sam waved his arm vaguely.
p298_386|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p260_321|We have got to get the points from this one.
p312_202|I believe that the answer is simple.

p237_316|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.

p231_080|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p314_395|The home team had an amazing start.
p374_197|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p283_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p229_167|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p283_371|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
0013_001350|Six was half way down the room.
p288_121|It has removed a bit of guilt.

p310_062|We're into that build-up now.
p326_305|By that time, however, it was already too late.

0018_000840|What an impetuous boy he is!
p234_208|Does the name matter ?
0019_000341|Enough,you foolish chatter.
p300_234|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p292_391|The police are not the target.
p283_035|It could well be the case.
0017_001642|Give me your hand or I will cry harder than before.
0016_001184|Rare rabbit had a little apron.

p277_106|Our position remains unchanged.
0016_000275|You shouldn't have pricked him with your horn.
en006_enthusiastic_326|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.

p267_125|They could use a boost.
p318_327|Medical staff are with them at the moment.

p259_179|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.)
p231_472|He felt it was the right time.

0014_001344|Now I understand.
p292_211|People have no chance of getting out.
p230_107|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p243_326|I feel as if I can hole everything now.

0016_001516|No, I burst the balloon!

p267_213|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p244_219|THE force is with them.
p265_231|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
0014_000315|It's to say how  you do with Tom's answer.
p351_262|I certainly hope not.
p247_398|It is a simple equation.)
0014_001658|Mum shuts one's mouth up, doesn't it.
0020_000324|And she caught at the brooch.
0019_000322|A special pot too.

0016_000545|A boat put out on the bay.

p273_396|He put some colour into Scottish history.
0015_001748|Dear customer,welcome to our ship.
0013_001150|Well anyhow it didn't rain, he said.
p306_111|I'm not a diva.
p254_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p250_088|Potions said he would drive.
p267_108|That admission is not surprising.
en002_angry_371|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p279_164|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p273_263|Her body has never been found.
en002_angry_298|This latter point is hugely important.
p286_386|One-third of the places are already taken.

p250_119|No, the equipment is extra.
p308_068|YOU thought it was a headache.

p227_123|So what is the campaign about ?
p294_083|That was enough for the committee.
0013_000739|Our thanks to God's oath.
0011_000108|The squire himself showed perfect.
p364_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
en007_neutral_388|We have seen a copy of the report.
p308_059|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
en007_neutral_292|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p234_250|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
0018_001720|Goat Billy asked the old chinese guy.

0014_000819|The owl flew into a bush.
p374_301|The atmosphere is businesslike.
0014_000213|Let it give us a chance, my precious.
p246_184|There is no openness.
p363_076|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p252_030|Schools do not create that.
p249_313|Is there on his hands?
p286_393|How do you take them away ?

0019_000739|Our thanks to God's oath.
p307_114|He took away my childhood.
0017_000569|But the tune isn't his own invention.
p225_275|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p260_212|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p257_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.

p281_062|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p308_270|The outstanding issues are still there.
p281_036|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
0018_001522|Am I an absolute pauper?

p347_090|It is a hangover effect.
p300_039|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p236_371|The pair are very much in love.
p243_059|We just want this season to end.
p362_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.

p250_074|We need to increase the membership.
p305_400|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p345_118|We just want a fair deal.
en007_neutral_381|He is a great prospect.
0020_000888|Now quicker the fiddle went.

p247_425|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
p254_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
en007_enthusiastic_158|He deserves a second chance.
p335_226|Both sides have to step back.
p304_061|Trading Places was too obvious.
0020_000752|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.

0015_001321|I say I will be emperor.
0016_001492|Does the one that wins get the crowned?
p316_214|I am really sorry that he is going.
0011_000703|That I owe my thanks to you.
p301_193|He scored one goal and was on fire.

p281_341|It's just the way I play.
p273_130|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.

en007_neutral_066|She always wanted her own way.
p226_044|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p343_375|You have to do your research.
p281_314|We are in the end game.
p329_246|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
0016_000335|But things haven't change yet.

p239_340|It will affect their work.
p244_397|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p270_303|The effect was almost magical.
p335_403|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p266_032|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
0012_001727|It's part of my secret.
0017_000437|A hippo lives in the zoo.
p313_203|This is not a European Army.
p304_219|It isn't a happy memory.
0014_000628|I know you .
p292_408|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p335_095|These guys will not lie down.
p275_376|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.

0015_000310|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.
p273_066|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p270_341|There was some merit in that.
p248_285|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p246_060|Scotland had great assets.
p341_396|But it is all by design.
p301_065|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p272_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p250_092|That view is held by many others within the industry.
0013_000915|He likes dragons very much.
p302_309|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p271_075|There could be a way back.

p374_046|It is so out of character.
p297_350|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.

p306_142|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
0012_001358|Perhaps you think there is a queer title for this chapter.
en003_angry_082|There was some merit in that.
p330_035|There were no reported injuries.

0011_001720|Goat Billy asked the old chinese guy.
0011_001554|He dreamt them all night.
0017_001589|When such wanderers meet.
0016_001600|That cloth does not look like worth much!
p310_129|We stopped at half-time.
p333_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
0019_000286|One two three, where is your breakfast.
0015_000348|Dear customer,welcome to our ship.
p347_158|That's been our position all along.
p330_243|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p286_237|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p281_236|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.

p237_201|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p243_125|I think there's not much between them.
p255_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p259_171|It's never great to finish second.)
p249_280|There's nothing I can say.
p280_355|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p266_045|Among them are many criminals.
p244_388|I would be interested in another attempt.
p253_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
0015_000126|will this turn goes to the hill.
p267_078|He can win every week.
p284_101|They tried to deny it.
en006_angry_384|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p329_401|We are now open.
p301_274|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p339_122|There could be a possible connection.
p374_398|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
0020_001302|I am run off my feet.
p271_360|It is a memorial.
0019_001571|I say neither yea nor nay.
0016_001199|My winding sheet!
p263_093|The trick is to try it.
p329_034|We don't know the scale of need.
p277_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
0015_001116|Shall we let barbara in?
p285_148|I was on a roll.
0018_001655|This was the twenty fifth of november, seventeen eighty three.

p270_160|How independent is that ?
p308_334|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334_046|No meaningful response was issued.
p313_391|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p336_096|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
0015_000318|The name of the song is called haddocks.
0020_001196|He said to Jack, the chatterer.

p279_228|My neighbours are horrified.
p334_383|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p273_290|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
0020_001350|Six was half way down the room.
p363_266|Two other men have recovered.
en007_neutral_275|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p362_254|We did not play well.
en006_neutral_333|I decided to take my time.
p301_196|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p253_033|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
0011_000499|My winding sheet!
en002_enthusiastic_304|We will look into it.
en007_enthusiastic_270|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p266_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p282_284|This is a national crisis.
p248_114|It's not a new concept in jazz.
0015_000572|Ask god to help you.
p254_101|However, it did not end that way.
0019_001211|That's a full grown colt.
p275_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p299_123|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p308_195|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p266_077|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p228_176|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.

p297_245|I am sorry to hear this news.
p351_363|You will never forget the clutching horror.
0011_000946|We can not do it sir.
p300_051|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
en002_angry_014|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p233_290|All options are open.
0014_000266|We may join with that power.
0019_000832|I thank you for this mercy!
0016_000770|Tom now let our arrows fly!
p361_254|It came in bits and pieces.
p278_286|I'd like to report a murder.
p360_252|But it was too late.
0016_000434|By hook or by crook.
0015_001664|Slam the doors and wedge them!
p307_329|I played well on Saturday and again today.
0015_001370|Goat Billy asked the old chinese guy.
p266_186|What has caused the demise of singing?
p330_109|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p226_080|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
0011_001438|Hold up my chin, slow and solid.
0020_000829|A large flat ferry boat was moored beside it.
p316_121|It's very ingenious.
p283_147|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p312_337|But he did not rule out further talks.
p343_095|And so it goes on.
0012_001208|it looks much better.
p280_077|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p336_371|It looked like a war zone.
p264_050|The Office is a show about nothing, then.)
en001_neutral_100|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
0016_000345|A whirring noise was heard.
0012_000832|I thank you for this mercy!
0018_001671|I say I will be emperor.
p271_316|My whole life has changed.
p228_292|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
0011_000453|The elephant and the carpenter is the longest.
p312_261|It was that bad, that low.
p364_257|That can happen so easily.
p253_124|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
0011_000490|What an impetuous boy he is!
en001_enthusiastic_052|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p229_332|I'd like to take the plunge.
0019_001216|They ate beef at the butcher shop.
p314_221|The text is reduced to bubbles.
0012_000311|I am back safe again.
0018_001137|A hippo lives in the zoo.
0016_000856|The eye could not catch them.
0019_000714|Annie please please don't hurt me!
en006_enthusiastic_219|That was the difference between the sides.
p302_213|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p361_108|The results are very positive.
en001_angry_071|The script was funny.
p292_269|It is a very beautiful city.
p263_312|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
0012_001730|She keeps saying I'm hers.
p301_100|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p374_341|I'm looking forward to that.
p263_237|That you can do it.
p341_045|Her daughter is getting married.
p234_177|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
0017_001421|As rich as Peter's son in law!
0018_001472|How are you, dear child?
p345_165|We don't have a solution to the problem.
p343_252|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p323_296|I have never seen anything like it.
p345_111|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p311_214|Openness is always the best way.
p272_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p252_313|It was a total surprise.

0012_000819|The owl flew into a bush.
p238_221|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
0014_001231|First, issue a reward.
p228_193|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
en002_enthusiastic_190|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
0017_000090|And they did push so!
0012_000488|But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
en006_enthusiastic_237|There was just fire all around me.
p232_284|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p318_229|It does not take much.
p283_090|You have to respect the office.
0016_000438|In my opinion that is a good idea!
p281_375|There was a thing in front of the camera.
0011_000626|Can your name be more hilarious?
0011_001147|Confess that you opened the thirteenth door.
p230_344|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p361_344|You've got to hand it to them.
p318_261|He was in contention almost every week.
p244_075|This time, it might be for real.
0019_001257|What am I, I'm a racer, son of god.
0018_001057|I'm as bad as I can be.
0020_001498|Said the witch.

p257_025|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
0017_001003|I am loath to see him go.
p272_180|They need to look after themselves.
0016_001333|They had been named Tom and Jerry.

0012_000215|He likes dragons very much.
0017_001578|And vowed he'd change the pigtail's place.
p308_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
0017_000578|It says no way! shouted Daisy.
p238_072|I had relied on him.
p301_224|It had a gigantic effect.
p363_401|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p326_167|About the bad things that happened to me.
p311_267|There is no signature.
p246_091|It was clear.
0012_000843|Pussy can sit by the fire and sing.
en001_neutral_261|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p306_219|I might get an injury very easily.
0020_001722|A special pot too.
p257_345|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
0013_001191|Can I lodge here tonight?
0011_000985|The straw, charcoal and the pea.
p295_083|I had found my vision.
0013_000295|I know how to obey orders.

0015_000176|She just smiled calmly, mother knows that is the best smile.
en002_neutral_130|My son was too young to die.

p252_316|Motherwell took them from half chances.
0015_000009|On the twenty second of last march.

0019_001677|The end part is fish mouth.

p374_364|I disagree entirely with the decision.
0020_000109|If they mother knew it.
p313_249|We should be rewarded for producing.
p257_138|It is also well received.

p287_062|It has been an amazing day.

p334_335|They've not let anyone into the loop.
p336_252|She has a little boy.

en006_angry_113|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p238_271|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
p276_250|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
0014_001012|Father has yellow eyes.
p255_104|Further protests are likely.
0017_000128|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!
0017_001145|Aha what have i we here?
p231_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p243_046|How do you take them away ?
p361_129|How do you take them away?
p286_347|Do you think we are a top nation ?
0013_001309|The song is called Ways and Means.
0014_000767|I suppose no, it doesn't!
p339_212|If that's the case, he will struggle.
en007_enthusiastic_184|Failure is not an option.
0011_001296|We can not do it sir.
0017_001126|The hag looked in the stove.

p257_245|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p323_380|He must be seen to be impartial.

p295_386|That, however, is only part of the story.
p293_225|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
en006_enthusiastic_037|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p245_291|We have to sort it out ourselves.
0014_000525|All this we won by our labour.
p263_408|It was an amazing afternoon.
p303_257|They seem to be backing off from that.
p255_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329_274|I'd never heard him in person before.
0018_000997|How Tom and Jerry went to visit mister Sam.

p227_050|That is very hard, alone.
p323_265|It's a very high number.
0020_001031|She'll be feverish after so much thinking.
0016_000408|The octopus has eight legs.
p312_137|I was blown out of proportion.
0016_001040|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
p305_317|The budget was too low for that.
en001_enthusiastic_350|This is a club on the rise.
p363_217|I was amazed at her knowledge.
p295_347|Four years is a long time.
0015_000045|The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs.
0017_001616|it isn't picked at all.
p225_136|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
0014_000627|The end part is fish mouth.
p284_390|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
en001_neutral_128|She really suffered for her art.
en001_angry_111|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.

p250_473|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
p343_245|They have not been named.
p283_180|They should stop the bombing.
0011_001495|Aha what have i we here?
p239_191|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p297_111|What was it like playing real people?
p294_415|I don't entirely buy that.
0016_000146|He said to Jack, the chatterer.
en001_angry_312|The airport was even different.
0019_000768|I do not eat bread.
0020_001132|A fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be!
p298_060|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p339_280|But that's another story.
0011_001641|We have showed his shark tooth.
0011_001617|You cruelty shall cost your life !
en007_enthusiastic_028|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p292_386|He is just a wonderful actor.
p244_389|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p267_420|I've got my own ideas.
en001_angry_362|It has been made to entertain.
p343_081|Once they go away they won't come back.
0020_001441|I chose the right way.
p301_171|The problem arises because he does so much.
p310_110|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p272_200|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
en007_enthusiastic_373|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
en007_enthusiastic_297|I have spoken to head office.
p248_333|I said that I had been raped.
0016_001707|I owe them five hundred dollars.
0016_000312|Father has yellow eyes.
en006_enthusiastic_380|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p287_381|It's as wide as a church in here.
p308_203|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p281_446|But we have built a platform for next season.
p314_168|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p310_296|That was the most annoying thing.
0019_000672|A special pot too.
en003_angry_284|He's been hit by it.
p341_124|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p253_115|It was the eighties.
p266_180|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p363_084|They are difficult awards to decide.
0015_001617|You cruelty shall cost your life !
p251_346|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p364_248|It was something special.
0018_001287|What would they do at the end of the year?
en003_angry_076|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
0011_000731|All smile were real and the happier the more sincere .
en001_enthusiastic_119|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p238_119|What form did that take ?
p307_300|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
0014_000165|They were going fast, with a light clip.
0011_001082|Who is been repeating all that hard stuff to you?
p278_133|That would open the gates of hell.
p273_167|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p306_316|I've been thinking about it for a year.
en001_neutral_084|Detection is often difficult.
p244_360|It was a test in itself.
p249_202|It is a case of taking a risk.
0019_000873|He searched through the box.
0018_000200|That cloth does not look worth much!
p273_077|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
0015_001060|A nauseous draught.
p298_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
0011_001526|this turn goes to the hill.
p261_465|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
0011_000866|They ate beef at the butcher shop.
p262_133|She died at her home.

0012_001517|They were children of mine.
p280_392|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p254_229|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p295_227|We don't have any senior players.
p229_301|I thought it was my only chance.
p229_058|What was the main difference ?
en001_neutral_235|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p298_316|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
en001_enthusiastic_323|I'd like to take the plunge.
p254_244|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
0017_000802|This is Jack, the relatives of Tom.
p343_157|I can't believe the buzz.
p270_231|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
p314_128|Police were also perplexed.
0015_001181|It must come sometimes to jam a day.
p264_466|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.)
p340_215|The seller was not revealed.
0011_000725|She is now choosing skirt to wear.
p252_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
en006_angry_345|It's not good at all.
p234_316|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
p336_166|Nobody could survive on that.
p268_342|Plans were made to expand.
p298_040|I let go the telephone and ran.
p273_310|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312_373|He said he needed no more evidence.
0015_000540|And they were sandy yellow brownish all over.
p233_351|He agreed with my proposal.
p225_358|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p255_182|We wanted it left for a wee while.
0017_000999|His hope will cheat him.
0013_001643|And has you slain him?
p240_128|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
0017_000046|They'd never know I'd regular ran away.

0018_001053|That I owe my thanks to you.
p236_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
en002_angry_157|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p279_264|Blood samples were taken.
p323_095|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p312_215|The dangers are very obvious.
p347_228|The damage has been done.
p293_230|We had no idea that this letter existed.
p298_128|A lot of people were in tears.
0016_001547|And there you'll find a snap dragon fly.
p254_286|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p333_065|This is only the start of my season.
p311_132|Did he always want to be a comedian?
p238_354|They're going to open in early summer.
p264_396|It has been only average.)
p311_138|We are still the best team in Britain.
p238_130|Potions said he would drive.
0019_000039|Our thanks to God's oath.
0014_001103|He was still in the forest!
0014_001631|He told me that I ought to change.
p297_424|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p336_074|Yet what is supposed to be said?
en002_angry_017|Clearly, they had other problems.
p362_261|I can't deny that fact.

p347_202|Before the games it was pretty open.

p243_083|That kind of growth is the important thing.
0015_001057|I'm as bad as I can be.
p284_376|It is a simple equation.
p317_048|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
p254_269|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.

p347_336|This is the start of a new campaign.
0013_000231|He told me that I ought to change.
0020_000939|This is the way that snakes always talk.
p269_063|It's that kind of place.
p272_141|I had decided to quit the show.
p351_391|All were believed to be adults.
0018_001685|The straw, charcoal and the pea.
0012_000748|You are not a runaway,who are you?

0014_000231|He told me that I ought to change.
p234_358|Something is going to have to give.

p311_104|But things are never the same again.
p330_258|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.

p270_244|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p351_056|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
en007_enthusiastic_219|Or maybe it's the other way around.
0012_000755|A deafening chirruping rent the air.
p302_092|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p250_402|Theatre is not a museum.
0014_000739|Our thanks to God's oath.
p286_093|So, did she meet him ?
p268_382|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
0015_001618|I'll send for Tom to my boudoir.
en007_enthusiastic_043|Nobody said it was required.
p295_261|I think it'll be a great occasion.
0017_000605|This was the twenty fifth of november, seventeen eighty three.
p234_118|When we looked at the company.
p279_238|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p273_153|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
p239_360|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
0015_000192|I have had to grow old.
en006_angry_094|He said the director had been completely friendly.

p230_091|The conclusion is the same.
p254_281|If not, he should go home.
p281_185|The referee had a good game.
p329_231|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p284_367|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
0015_000766|Shall we let barbara in?
0017_000246|We can not do it sir.
p374_143|I told the players that at half-time.
p280_407|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
p362_147|I don't think we deserved to lose.
p266_260|Souter will be back.
0017_001667|Chapter eleven on the doorstep.
p330_216|We are not far from a deal.
p236_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p253_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.

0013_000778|The art quite safe with me.
p237_206|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
en002_enthusiastic_233|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
0011_001311|After a while he perceived both giants.
p287_085|It was clear on Thursday.
p297_158|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
0016_000990|There goes the shawl again!
p294_280|It was one in the afternoon.
en001_angry_264|It's a way of life.
p282_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
0014_001045|A whirring noise was heard.
p253_084|I first met him last summer.
p236_340|Even the one she loved.
p274_349|That is a trend which will be encouraged.)
0018_001245|A boat put out on the bay.
p297_097|I was doing well at the hustings.
p360_207|The baby was dead.
p293_109|The objective was achieved.
p301_336|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
en001_angry_065|It's a matter of balance.
0011_001114|And we are so thirsty!
p252_407|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p335_138|This is not presently the case.
0014_001313|She said in subdued voice.
p281_264|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
0016_000695|A whirring noise was heard.
0012_000070|Tom now let our arrows fly!
0019_000877|Tom fell with a cloven head.
p311_321|This was another video cassette.
p340_379|It feels like a winner already.
p259_241|Anyway, the job will be part-time.)
p335_134|We are trying to clarify the issues.
0012_000517|I toy with my liqueur.
p270_329|It is a court case.
p240_120|It is a delight on every level.
p278_205|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p339_111|I always liked to get a laugh.
p374_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
0012_001582|Age forty five if a day a lie.
0020_000685|But things haven't change yet.
p270_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p318_061|The firm was down and almost out.
p335_064|This must be wrong.
p284_380|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p301_135|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p244_153|Others are expected to follow the lead.
p330_249|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p312_237|We must not give in to the bastards.
p265_343|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p278_310|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p335_092|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p249_230|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p255_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p330_102|The feeling is marvellous.
0014_001567|I toy with my liqueur.
p281_265|I should think so, too.
en001_neutral_047|But it might have done.
p351_201|I went away to recover fully.
p258_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p256_263|The pensioners did not want to know.
p245_091|They were outside the circle.
p264_390|It is the same with Barry.)
p305_124|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p266_242|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p339_294|But it will not work again.
p341_119|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p272_049|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
en001_angry_393|You did not see it.
p336_110|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p274_189|But there's an upturn in the sector.)
p238_374|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p341_135|Yet he chose to do something different.
p339_173|I was very influenced by him.
0016_000373|I thought you meant how old are you?
en001_neutral_162|It is too much for me.
p248_210|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p269_310|But it's a subtle process.
p263_299|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p299_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p274_058|We will pay their bills.)
p236_305|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p261_161|The pension levels will remain the same.
p330_069|This is a most serious matter.
p330_099|There's nothing for the kids.
0017_001740|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
p231_099|Two of the team became ill.
0012_000168|I said you looked like an egg, sir.
p286_443|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
en006_angry_103|It seemed a logical expansion.
0013_000933|Why should i care though David's lips were twitching?
p261_062|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
0017_001010|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.
0016_001633|who i should i care though David's lips were twitching?
p335_299|He said he was sorry.
p276_038|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p298_212|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p247_319|His appeal is instantly understood.)
p253_067|And if he hadn't become a musician?
0011_000296|You woke me up!
en006_enthusiastic_051|They have no real friends in the region.
p256_174|It is not either national standards or local control.
0016_001275|Her existence makes him pleasant.
0018_000749|Then we all say aha!
0011_000329|And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.
0019_000523|He searched through the box.
0020_000039|Our thanks to God's oath.
p313_177|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p287_212|It had all been arranged.
p299_331|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p329_334|That is not the way we should operate.
p279_244|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p225_123|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p248_310|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p225_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
0019_000529|Daisy creams with pink edges.

p233_104|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p297_075|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
0017_001256|Still you owe it a duty.
0017_001264|But what about this thing, sticky!
p241_232|Hospitals are for the ill.
p300_096|He told us about it the next day.
p247_436|There is another important factor.)
p285_329|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
0019_000485|I blinked my eyes hard.
0013_001227|Tom fell with a cloven head.
0013_000533|Fresh pain seized Paul's body.
p277_317|Is there a new way forward?
p335_184|We didn't think anything would happen.
p340_179|They are just trying to cover up.
0012_001010|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.
p311_226|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p280_025|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p277_258|Immediate action must be taken.
0017_000356|Andy what's the gyre and to the gimble.
p255_232|We played them off the pitch.
0015_001074|The football teams give a tea party.
p255_049|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p276_447|We go there with confidence.
p287_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.

0014_000406|Your midget wife never can sing a song.
p262_099|Two of the team became ill.
0019_000150|I hope you enjoyed yourself?
0019_001106|Your midget wife never can sing a song.
p238_088|It was exactly four months away.
0015_001204|He dreamt them all night.
0014_001495|Aha what have i we here?
p260_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p246_079|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p313_230|She asked us a lot of questions.
0015_001142|Does the one that wins get the crowned?
p300_344|He was visited by UK consular officials.

0018_000347|What are you waiting for? man.
p248_199|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p266_209|I was so nervous.
p374_385|What's the best thing to do?
p311_057|It ended as it began, in confusion.
0015_001115|Tom could hardly speak for laughing.
p340_197|This was all well and good.
p279_205|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p282_155|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
0011_000261|After a while he perceived both giants.
p273_059|It was exactly four months away.
p268_381|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p225_268|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p257_340|It was very formal.
p231_418|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p307_163|This is a United Kingdom.
p230_278|None of this work is guaranteed.
p247_400|That investment has now been secured.)
p247_106|Our preference is to play in midweek.)
0019_001219|Sam waved his arm vaguely.
p243_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p362_262|She is now planning a visit.
p334_313|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p231_209|We are a new department.
p268_056|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p233_100|It should be a condition of employment.
p305_231|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p314_037|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
0015_000201|A lady, is on Alice's lap!
p271_224|He seemed to lose his focus.
0015_001411|Chapter ten a warm welcome.
0013_001091|I chose the right way.
p273_033|That is the face of fear.
p228_029|I feel I did not have enough time.
en006_neutral_203|I'd love to be like Peter.
p273_081|They lived for their children.
p253_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p301_181|This does not create any precedent.
p251_316|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.

p259_035|Because he was born in England.)
p374_153|But opinion was divided.
p317_105|His handling raises a wider issue.

p251_154|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p245_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p272_223|Until they came to do it.

p329_038|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
0016_001380|She keeps saying I'm hers.

p236_277|We run within the law.

p362_322|I don't think it's very real.
0019_000203|I was not grabbed.
0018_001243|Please hire me after you.
p343_150|I'm going to win the gold.
p236_230|I had relied on him.

0018_001307|I would scoff at these followers.
en007_neutral_240|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.

en001_enthusiastic_294|This is a war over our home.

p363_268|The test case is still awaiting action.
p265_159|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.

p230_043|The big problem is the lack of grass.
p364_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
0019_001740|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
p308_207|Why should we even be asked to share?
0013_001092|She may mind ye of her.

p273_091|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p269_166|I've put my own money into this project.
p244_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p287_221|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
0016_001237|An hour out of Guildford town.
p262_241|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
0011_000673|Why did I wake up!
0018_001195|Reed by the living pool!

p282_261|He has not created a Festival resource.
p295_168|He should emerge as the winner.

p298_318|We have grown up in Britain.
0017_001467|I suppose no, it doesn't!
0017_001118|I do not eat bread.
0012_001079|Rat came and replied on the leaves.
p247_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
p228_079|I had my suspicions.
0019_000216|well it isn't picked at all.
p297_402|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p345_204|Things were so intense in the studio.
p248_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
0013_000768|I do not eat bread.
p243_320|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
0012_001301|The ladybug told them proudly.

p248_141|He has the edge.
p259_159|The two companies were not for sale.)
p330_196|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
0019_001195|Reed by the living pool!
p280_252|The rise has come too late for some.
p307_377|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
0016_001661|After a while he perceived both giants.
p298_389|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p333_222|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p247_376|That is a crazy situation.)
en007_enthusiastic_105|They may be wrong.
en001_neutral_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
en002_neutral_027|This fact is supported by audience research.
p311_070|It happens in many countries.
0015_001680|Your path now goes south.
p228_362|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p251_374|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p257_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p340_256|It was quite simply, delicious.
p260_065|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p287_414|YOU thought it was a headache.
p261_211|I chose to go by the rules.
p246_130|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p318_362|It was the same at Twickenham.
0020_000780|Then there was a report.
p258_134|My conscience is not clear.
p300_366|And here is the rub.
p273_124|That is the ultimate revenge.
0016_000652|Five hundred and one million right?
p362_282|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p259_441|It was submitted without their knowledge.)
p314_289|I'm not putting myself down.
p336_275|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
0012_001228|And vowed he'd change the pigtail's place.
p237_272|This is a big club.
p265_211|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p276_408|It has to be enforced.
0014_000648|She come back to the valley.
p251_254|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
en003_angry_001|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
0013_000092|Does the one that wins get the crowned?
p341_030|Gilbert was not amused.
en002_enthusiastic_309|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p226_261|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
0017_000805|He was killed by an arrow.
p343_048|He is trying really hard.
0017_000727|Monster made a deep bow.
p303_124|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
0011_000502|Guilty for what do you rule?
p364_267|We try to keep it right.
0017_000424|Come on my jack in the boxes!
p301_372|His job was not advertised.
0012_000564|what are this thing, sticky!
p270_176|They could not match it.
0014_000863|How they went to the mountains to eat nuts.
0014_000979|These words behind the ears is nonsense.
p252_078|So is that it, then ?
p299_292|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p251_307|This is a national crisis.
0019_001631|He told me that I ought to change.
0012_000036|How I hate this foul pool!
0011_001182|I thank you for this mercy!
p227_220|There is no quick fix.
p227_075|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p247_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
0020_000920|Her paw went into your eye?
p293_138|Somehow they got out.
p229_046|But it took a lot of bottle.
p230_056|We will pay their bills.
p284_369|Their time has gone.
p231_285|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p241_199|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p274_311|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.)
p247_191|I put the drawing down.)
0012_000015|Poor Tom now is dead!
p264_217|Now we have fresh hope.)
0012_000599|You may imagine how I gape.
p253_135|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p243_175|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p302_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p225_354|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
en007_neutral_159|There's nothing we could do about this.
p334_408|It remains in public ownership.
p258_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p326_240|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
0012_001732|where are you going?
p234_129|Three days later, he was killed.
0011_001724|And she caught at the brooch.
p374_200|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p264_032|He added that her comments were noted.)
0012_000561|From each cake, there sprang a huge dog.
p236_328|After some discussion they did.
0015_000563|Let it give us a chance, my precious.
0015_000327|It's part of my secret.
0020_001283|Why should i care though David's lips were twitching?
0020_001258|However, somebody killed something.
p330_214|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p345_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
0014_001186|She has eaten the tapioca all of it.
p334_370|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p278_043|Must be prepared to use it.
p336_209|The claim was denied by the first minister.
p317_268|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
p323_107|It's up to their parents to choose.
0012_000568|I'll send for Tom to my boudoir.
p281_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p284_249|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
0016_000628|I know you .
0018_001335|The straw, charcoal and the pea.
p274_446|It wouldn't matter if he had.)
0013_000879|Daisy creams with pink edges.
p299_257|It's one up to the Scots.
en002_angry_253|But he has a lifeline.
p228_164|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
0013_001694|Now I understand.
p260_040|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p262_281|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p258_385|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p245_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p363_087|He later told The Herald, It is true.
p284_141|That group reported just before Christmas.
en006_angry_223|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
0016_001517|They were children of mine.
p243_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
0018_000818|Look out! said Alice.
0011_001004|How do you like you dirty bird!
p297_201|I think it will make a huge difference.
0017_000616|We may join with that power.
en007_neutral_392|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
p283_463|This morning I got a call from my wife.
p275_311|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
0015_001244|Yes, I miss her.
0018_000712|Her shoes were like fishes.
p340_258|Thankfully it was cleared up.
0017_001727|It's part of my secret.
en002_neutral_370|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p278_340|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p239_262|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
0016_000342|Why should I purchase my own?
p268_350|I am considered a teenager.
p299_156|I am still very much a director.
p303_204|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
en007_enthusiastic_240|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p277_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p249_284|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p250_152|We will try to find someone.
0018_000950|Her kind and firm glance.
p307_280|That nation is South Africa.
p284_189|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
0013_000603|I have a soothsayer.
0018_001327|The end part is fish mouth.
0012_001518|Look out! said Alice.
0017_000273|I'd just as soon swim your way as others do.
0013_001152|This is Jack, the relatives of Tom.
p247_028|Because we do not need it.)
p374_246|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
en001_angry_242|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p231_409|How do you take them away ?
0017_001705|The fisherman and his wife see George every day.
0014_000654|How do you like you dirty bird!
p239_215|That group reported just before Christmas.
0017_001628|It says no way! shouted Daisy.
p274_296|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.)
en007_enthusiastic_340|That is not the case.
0016_001651|The ladybug told them proudly.
0018_001689|No, said piggy carelessly.
p333_317|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p249_093|And rugby fans can help.
p254_324|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p274_187|It could be done by experts and lawyers.)
en006_enthusiastic_352|This much I can tell you.
p274_307|They have shown a great desire and attitude.)
p267_157|I would probably have to agree with him.
p273_111|Then again, we could have.
p295_075|This time, there were no such rewards.
en003_angry_006|They almost achieved a draw.
0014_001654|She laughed.
0013_001177|Cos I know I had some honey.
p299_259|He is a right bastard.
p259_455|Nobody has told the story.)
0020_000835|I blinked my eyes hard.
0019_001621|I am a selfish sinner.
0012_001330|Your path goes south.
p228_208|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p276_029|What do we do ?
0012_000217|You cruelty shall cost your life !
0016_001261|From each cake, there sprang a huge dog.
p236_080|They lived for their children.
p240_302|We have to sort it out ourselves.
0015_000459|If they mother knew it.
p295_213|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p301_327|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p237_190|They receive a high profile in the media.
p251_368|We will be homeless.
p334_232|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p299_374|I didn't do too badly myself.
p323_030|This is the best way to do it.
en002_neutral_268|The defender made an impressive debut.
p261_390|The result is called a patent.
p267_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
0016_001001|I'm sure your friends can wait!
p340_027|We've just decided to do something about it.
p306_169|Who do these people think they are?
p253_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
0016_001591|I make her quite nervy at times.
p326_074|More patience and composure was required.
p276_302|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p245_139|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p245_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p268_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p313_091|It's a very, very special day.
p341_177|This is a huge confidence boost.
p323_206|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
0018_001656|I must have two to fetch and carry.
p249_344|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
0015_000589|This is the way that snakes always talk.
0013_000219|But the tune isn't his own invention.
p284_062|It's that kind of place.
0013_001203|But we are not high yet.
p347_220|It could not be too high.
p293_327|Life is too short.
p292_383|Politics is a tough game.
p361_371|Well, you don't have time.
0020_000257|I would scoff at these followers.
p283_447|Something has got to give.
p280_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p302_247|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p243_296|The strong performance is expected to continue.
en002_angry_136|We did what we had to do.
p363_136|But it's a subtle process.
p298_373|I might also completely change the routine.
p335_264|I try not to expect anything.
0015_000425|I'd far rather go without them than eat them!
p361_419|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
0016_000792|Does the one that wins get the crowned?
p274_361|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.)

p295_330|That's always the case, isn't it?
p304_325|I hope he has learned from it.
p340_031|He was very close.
p277_064|That's the truth.
en003_angry_137|This could be a mistake.
en006_angry_226|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
p243_051|I'm as fit as I can get.
p272_225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.

p277_179|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.

p247_186|It is vital to clarify their role.)

p293_084|However, it's good to turn the page.
p239_350|Translation - we got it wrong.
0016_001349|His hope will cheat him.
0015_001377|It's part of my secret.
0014_000307|I owe them five hundred dollars.
0016_000413|Asteroid three hundred and twenty five.
p330_078|The way ahead is not easy.
p266_337|Two people were interviewed.
p274_374|It had been a magical moment.)
p283_226|You could feel the heat.
p343_385|It almost certainly is.
p259_219|The early physical reports were clear.)
p226_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p287_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.

p258_087|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p316_196|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p333_308|I think that could work to our advantage.

en002_neutral_078|We want to help them through it.
p273_382|It benefits the whole family.
p292_045|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p314_073|You can't go on forever.
p299_092|We certainly will need to watch him.
p317_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p257_279|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
0019_001289|This the way that snakes always talk.
p299_219|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
0019_001238|Now quicker the fiddle went.
en006_neutral_004|It is the same in Sweden.
p351_227|That, though, was then.
p274_152|It was by the numbers.)
p257_270|It was a privilege to work for him.
0015_000577|Born once every one hundred years, dies in flames!
p234_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.

0012_001314|Slam the doors and wedge them!
p267_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p268_374|That remains the unanswered question.
en007_neutral_283|I was there five months ago.
p292_342|I had to win this race.
p339_231|I think we can get there.
p268_072|We deserved the three points.
p275_360|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
0019_000387|I think it'll encourage me.
en006_enthusiastic_065|She runs like her mother.
en002_angry_189|This is the highlight of my career.
p317_056|That tells you something about them.
0017_000404|Are you a regular darkey really?
p237_159|It is not normal practice.
p247_038|You must always attempt to raise the bar.)
p300_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p257_172|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p294_213|We are very, very pleased with the response.
p278_373|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
en006_angry_379|The procedures were not in place.
p286_049|We are certainly talking about many millions.
0015_000854|He dreamt them all night.
p266_251|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p251_062|It's that kind of place.
p294_062|Debate is not just talk.

p268_232|Years ago it was really quite simple.
p259_370|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.)
0020_000096|I don't painted tiger.

p295_095|I had some time with Aston Villa.
0020_000468|Look out! said Alice.
0011_001560|Kitty, can you play chess?
p293_393|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p244_084|Why do it otherwise ?
p274_385|It will be completed within a year.)
en002_enthusiastic_005|You've got to have both sides.
en007_neutral_321|It's nice to be involved.
p303_220|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p231_130|It plans to return to this field.
p243_110|Some young girls also came by last night.
p317_401|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p362_040|They had a confession.
p285_085|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p282_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p259_355|We want to play at the worlds.)
p306_351|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p306_185|I am writing a novel.
0014_000982|Alice I won't forget it again.
0018_000693|And what does it mean?
p276_234|It was started almost by accident.
p264_125|We beat the Welsh team.)
p236_139|That view has not altered.
p261_305|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p264_311|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)
p227_130|He is a great addition to our team.
p307_123|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p228_103|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
0015_001389|And be with you,Tom!
en002_angry_074|What will happen then ?
p361_171|We can't go on like this.
0014_000984|Chapter eighteen, the return journey.
p317_238|He did not report it.
0015_000756|Your midget wife never can sing a song.
p276_133|No one person or small group could be singled out.
0013_000324|And she caught at the brooch.
0014_000050|Rabbit gave dog a hurrying up sort of nudge.
0019_001138|In my opinion that is a good idea!
0020_000488|But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
p278_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
0019_000076|The hag looked in the stove.
p316_144|I am not retiring.
p340_111|But we still don't know.
0016_000812|Clown, to call him joey.
p255_303|Our task is to complete the picture.
0015_000492|Wake up my merry tads!
0013_001379|And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.

p345_245|This is wonderful news.

en006_angry_287|It was fit for royalty.
p282_100|It is a love affair.
p270_190|They need to look after themselves.
p272_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
0017_000886|She jump at the tail and bite it savagely.
p230_184|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p228_148|It is difficult for Ali.
0013_000103|The elephant and the carpenter is the longest.
0014_001168|Look out! said Alice.
p351_331|That has not been the case, as we now know.
p297_284|They were not up to the required standard.
p264_236|Has the conflict started?)
p343_302|There is no point of looking any further.
p252_098|We're at home, which is important.
p285_282|Yet, it worked.
p298_063|That is a mark of what you are.
p271_370|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p271_231|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p303_148|All kinds of things occur.
en006_enthusiastic_349|I was just so determined.
p304_174|On Saturday, it was much the same.
0020_000657|I owe them five hundred dollars.
p292_320|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p330_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p343_220|I didn't actually work up a speech.
p258_316|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
en001_angry_306|The home team had an amazing start.
p301_328|He is young but not too young.
p264_136|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)
0011_000746|They'd never know I'd regular ran away.
en001_enthusiastic_266|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
0014_001046|I am going to go back home.
p230_373|It's going to be fun.
p275_125|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p302_200|They had not been handcuffed.
p254_263|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p347_348|He's got a great chance of making it.
en003_angry_109|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p271_407|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p318_280|One thing is sure.
0018_001303|I have a soothsayer.
p264_477|The child has denied murder.)

p272_257|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p310_180|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p257_268|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
0020_000176|She just smiled calmly, mother knows that is the best smile.
p326_258|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p302_177|His name is Michael Owen.

0014_000252|I am run off my feet.
p347_203|But you can go beyond that condition.
p257_062|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p288_208|Twaddle is a case in point.
p264_075|That is really all.)
0011_000846|He said to Jack, the chatterer.

p286_142|He said to give a local injection.
p234_285|Do you think we're a top nation ?
p249_171|We have to move forward.
en002_angry_019|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
p317_154|We told them in June.
p262_361|We will be homeless.
0012_000657|I owe them five hundred dollars.

0017_000253|I have a soothsayer.
p307_363|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p313_053|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p343_177|Two others were also seriously injured.
p267_047|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p307_296|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
en001_neutral_225|Police later said the scheme would end in November.

p345_093|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p326_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p250_083|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p317_319|So he is open to ideas.
p284_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
0020_000768|I do not eat bread.
p282_127|She really suffered for her art.
p326_223|She did not attend the courtroom.

p306_222|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
p308_127|They prefer the short, intensive session.
0015_001249|Captain Tom receives an angry letter.

p253_191|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
en001_enthusiastic_378|They will fight for everything.
p295_238|The party will make up its own mind.
p261_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.

0020_000969|But show me now your map!
en002_enthusiastic_217|But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.

p260_172|It is not either national standards or local control.
p339_306|But it did not last.
p253_200|Who will pay for this?
p293_114|You, the British people, are the boss.

0020_000687|But mom I'm not certain about.
p272_167|It is not like us.
p347_280|I could feel the blood on my face.
p374_048|However, it's good to turn the page.
p362_217|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p257_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.

p280_339|So is that it, then ?
p262_354|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p254_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p267_364|There may be reasons for it.
en002_enthusiastic_306|Getting this right is essential.
p268_398|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.

en002_neutral_289|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
0015_001015|It's how to say hi do you with Tom's answer.
p360_259|It makes me feel difficult.

p305_372|There is nothing like a fresh start.
0017_000336|Over them swooped the eagles.
en006_enthusiastic_063|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p232_186|It is the whole package.
p323_414|Now it's all written down.
p239_428|Or maybe it's the other way around.
0011_000424|Come on my jack in the boxes!
p233_177|The release attracted little attention.

0018_001103|He was still in the forest!
p265_302|My body is clearly capable.
p230_156|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.

p323_041|We know the quality of life goes up.
p268_206|We believe a third party was involved.
p285_357|It is a memorial.
p329_081|I was there for five hours.
p281_372|It's as wide as a church in here.
p276_219|What are you not good at ?
p255_199|However, this idea is never developed.

p249_101|It is an old family habit.
p292_169|I was never alone with her, right?
p231_244|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p233_080|On the night, it was not enough.
0013_000166|They ate beef at the butcher shop.
p336_354|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p326_339|We gave them the goal.
p273_159|The jury is still out.
p285_396|What happened in the summer?
0015_000986|One two three, where is your breakfast.
p276_080|Why do it otherwise ?
0017_000299|His hope will cheat him.
p256_306|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
en007_enthusiastic_121|It shows the right amount of progress.
p262_182|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
0013_001552|Guilty for what do you rule?
p364_079|He wanted to talk to me about it.
0016_001113|Asteroid three hundred and twenty five.
p303_174|I think we showed that after half time.
p251_295|It's a way of life.
0018_001272|Ask god to help you.
0017_000586|How rash you are!
p236_416|I never had a childhood.
p347_370|It's an internal matter.
p329_238|I would urge the Government to think again.
0013_000990|There goes the shawl again!
p236_336|That decision has already been made.
p281_067|It is a real problem.
en006_angry_334|We will try to find someone.
0017_000660|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.
p330_390|The line-up is a tasty one.
p244_262|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p341_222|It is all one-sided.
0016_001584|We have been fine, haven't we?
0017_001040|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
0019_000638|She has felt shy of it.
p347_297|However, consumers may take a different view.
p262_296|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p279_280|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
0014_000582|Will call her Lili, for short.
p341_069|We must put a marker down.
p246_033|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p227_097|The following are the principal provisions.
p303_086|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p364_144|I don't entirely buy that.
p330_307|The festival idea has been a great success.
p362_205|They should not be blamed for it.
en006_enthusiastic_229|It is somewhere to be.
0019_000748|You are not a runaway,who are you?
p312_410|He supported the decision to review the decision.
p323_113|I have played really well all year.
p293_326|It possibly depends on the position.
0012_000972|No admittance except on party business.
p283_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p313_321|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p277_262|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
0012_000338|Paul's teeth ached because of lemon.
p228_108|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
en002_neutral_392|I'm so angry.
en006_enthusiastic_299|Merger would be entirely logical.
0012_001179|A large flat ferry boat was moored beside it.
p347_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
0012_000680|She keeps saying I'm hers.
0020_001047|What are you waiting for? man.
p230_338|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p298_119|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p250_472|He certainly did a good job!
p236_356|So, did she meet him ?
0012_001596|Clear are your eyes and bright your breath!
p297_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p260_336|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p308_240|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p266_119|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
0016_001239|When such wanderers meet.
p314_336|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p297_207|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
0015_000055|A deafening chirruping rent the air.
p317_344|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
0015_001469|Not much use is it, sam?
0019_001157|Tom and Michael woke up the next morning.
p345_147|It plainly does not work.
0012_001445|The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs.
en006_angry_138|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
0020_001323|I'd just as soon swim your way as others do.
p236_469|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
0013_001586|She jump at the tail and bite it savagely.
p286_262|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
0015_000056|Your midget wife can never sing a song.
p257_096|The peace process will be buried!
0012_000825|To catch that bulrush root with my paw!
p363_299|He will have it within two weeks.
p287_082|He added that he felt undermined.
p347_209|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p262_095|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
en003_angry_134|In due course we will make an announcement.
p330_257|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p374_348|We won't go down without a struggle.
0017_000976|Can your name be more hilarious?
0014_001690|There goes the shawl again!
p227_351|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p330_057|And thought we would get away with it.
p326_369|Broke down and can't be fixed.
p318_095|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p259_075|I've had it for the exams.)
p326_106|Our people should be immune.
0015_001091|I chose the right way.
0020_001509|If they mother knew it.
p292_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
0016_000068|I do not eat bread.
0016_001526|this turn goes to the hill.
0011_001048|Dear customer,welcome to our ship.
0019_000525|All this we won by our labour.
0016_000985|The straw, charcoal and the pea.
p316_330|But we will not be scared.
en001_neutral_392|But we welcome this document.
0019_000109|If they mother knew it.
0013_000575|Her existence makes him pleasant.
p288_332|He was then replaced by Ross.
0013_000009|On the twenty second of last march.
p317_162|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p361_247|But those days are dead and gone.
0013_001430|Must a name mean something?
0015_001530|And would spoil my joke.
p345_043|However, there were some alarming findings.
0016_001430|Must a name mean something?
0015_000439|Let go of my top knot.
p257_184|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p262_275|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
0018_000097|Confess that you opened the thirteenth door.
0019_001629|The first year they sowed rye.
p230_366|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p226_200|Is that success?
0016_000178|And vowed he'd change the pigtail's place.
0020_000950|Her kind and firm glance.
0011_000718|Then sadly it is much farther.
p255_338|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
0017_000481|It must come sometimes to jam a day.
0017_001518|Look out! said Alice.
en006_angry_060|Before the game we went for a pint.
p286_451|The jury is still out.
p245_298|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
0011_001564|His large mouth curled into a sneer.
p278_247|It had so much to do with output.
p364_175|I'm delighted for the lads.
p232_114|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p249_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p277_039|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p363_270|However, that is not in itself enough.
0017_000266|We may join with that power.
0015_001326|Can your name be more hilarious?
p238_064|He will need that machine.
p254_375|It is a large number.
p274_146|The whole industry is a shambles.)
0014_001563|How they went to the mountains to eat nuts.
0015_000593|And has you slain him?
p241_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
0011_001570|But if you hadn't done them.
0012_000004|They went up to the dark mass job had pointed out.
p259_031|Everyone can have their opinion.)
p351_264|No other country has ever won this tournament.
0020_001416|Mister share man, I move for a division.
p362_109|A, The media has been great.
p239_107|There could be a way back.
0016_000079|All my gum tips gone as well.
0013_000097|Confess that you opened the thirteenth door.
en003_angry_399|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p292_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p276_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p245_142|Was this element always there?
p304_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p241_168|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p301_202|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p299_302|They were the better side on the day.
p261_095|You are like an animal.
p311_247|I believe in theatre.
p362_228|Sadly, they did not.
p241_055|Next league matches Celtic.
p259_280|No date has been fixed for his return.)
p227_236|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
en002_angry_171|It's a real challenge.
p323_408|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p333_329|I am not changing my event.
0014_000193|Please hire me after you.
0018_000225|Her existence makes him pleasant.
p233_383|It is unusual.
p245_176|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
en002_enthusiastic_035|They tried to deny it.
0016_000424|Come on my jack in the boxes!
p312_263|His arrival could be the making of them.
0018_000442|Does the one that wins get the crowned?
p282_071|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p228_174|The post will be unpaid.
p256_096|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p308_077|It is simple, really.
p284_039|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p229_168|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
0011_000867|I toy with my liqueur.
p284_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
0020_000055|A deafening chirruping rent the air.
en002_neutral_358|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
0020_001209|Such tunes are joy to a dancing fay.
p262_111|This film will be totally awesome.
p345_055|Others said he had gone too far.
p333_288|It's too big a risk to take.
0014_000815|He might call it, for example.
p313_057|We might be back next year.
p317_228|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p248_100|That would be unlawful.
0011_001520|Our King George is labourers.
p246_333|Two people were interviewed.
p308_092|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p263_224|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p251_329|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p293_064|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p351_133|That was my mistake.
p261_197|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p282_367|There wasn't a goal.
p295_107|He had a different agenda entirely.
0016_001709|He owed mister Lawson, I can't tell you how.
en002_angry_238|And then there's the racial hassle.
p364_240|It had happened to him.
0017_001438|Hold up my chin, slow and solid.
p299_319|It was chaotic and frightening.
p249_232|My neighbours are horrified.
0014_000693|And what does it mean?
en002_angry_085|It's not about defining styles.
0015_000624|Because he was a man with infinite resource and sagacity.
0011_001014|Bob goes to a new school.
0019_000918|I'll send for Tom to my boudoir.
0012_001585|The new born baby is stolen as we go.
p262_333|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
0012_000586|How rash you are!
p272_343|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p317_176|Thereafter he left Scotland.
en006_angry_243|There wasn't a goal.
p339_001|Please call Stella.
p318_124|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p298_323|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p255_299|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p282_161|Well, he should know.
p268_256|It's never great to finish second.
0015_000070|Tom now let our arrows fly!
0011_000166|They ate beef at the butcher shop.
p255_305|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p301_038|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p345_326|I was waiting for that question.
p363_254|We stopped at half-time.
p339_044|Labour has been found out on public spending.
p323_312|I'm very puzzled by it.
p254_204|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p301_228|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
en002_enthusiastic_062|It will be too hot.
0015_001070|At the roots of a bush of a grass.
p272_404|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
0020_000007|I'm as bad as I can be.
p226_124|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p263_146|Any success would have been an improvement.
0019_001408|That was his chief thought.
p305_331|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p312_166|And who would argue with that?
p253_317|Our message was inclusive.
p262_166|We have a budget in March.
p251_357|The composer will conduct.
p293_312|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
p272_260|He was also married with two children.
p244_363|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p343_398|There is no formula.
p239_398|We were beaten by the better team.
p298_108|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p345_283|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p339_250|It was not like that at all.
p236_359|Scotland is the home of golf.
p234_214|This is an interesting link.
p278_279|I'd never run for them.
p276_175|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
p306_303|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p310_063|It is the end of an era.
0013_000573|Pick, pick, pick!
p267_405|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
en001_neutral_089|It's never too late.
p303_180|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p295_071|We would have looked out for each other.
0018_000546|Clear are your eyes and bright your breath!
0015_001522|Am I an absolute pauper?
0016_000611|After a while he perceived both giants.
p306_039|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p317_101|This championship is different from the other majors.
p323_082|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
0011_001693|He is old fashioned but he is the best of men.
p339_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
0011_000361|Chapter ten a warm welcome.
p313_131|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p225_159|Neither side can win this war.
p270_253|Everything depends on the weather.
0012_001589|When such wanderers meet.
p228_293|Our task is to complete the picture.
p267_326|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p255_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318_108|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p297_051|I would like to stay with Rangers.
0013_001171|Finn and the fairy shoemaker.
p229_207|I wanted to put myself on the line.
en006_neutral_290|It is a vicious circle.
p268_113|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p277_248|Is that a serious question?
p280_034|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p335_383|There is a job to be done.
p239_285|It has been recorded twice.
p227_196|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p253_171|You had to go and see him.
p252_322|We are keen to see truth and justice.
0012_000808|The squire himself showed perfect.
en006_enthusiastic_154|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p305_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p233_346|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
en003_angry_236|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p287_379|I do not like to lose.
en006_neutral_302|They did not attack the themes of the book.
0011_001518|Look out! said Alice.
p244_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p336_081|The issues are not going to change.
p281_163|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
p263_055|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p333_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p298_300|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p251_237|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p304_276|It was by the numbers.
p300_100|My office is bare.
p270_447|It was to be inclusive.
p279_256|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p303_290|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p279_225|I am immensely sad.
p273_138|It would seem a natural progression.
p282_152|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
en002_angry_318|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
en006_enthusiastic_072|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
0020_000992|She has a high voice.
en001_angry_238|I was shocked.
p234_333|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p345_033|It's a lot of pressure on me.
0013_000170|But if you hadn't done them.
p300_066|He also does not get along with Christina.
p299_341|We just need the Government to act.
p279_373|It has been a lovely family occasion.
0012_000605|This was the twenty fifth of november, seventeen eighty three.
p316_399|I think we believed the tie was won.
p286_453|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
p362_423|Or, rather, it isn't.
0017_000149|My winding sheet!
en006_neutral_207|There were no reports of casualties.
p248_267|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p263_127|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p374_418|And well he might.
p252_327|Not one person spoke badly.
0011_000488|But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
p241_065|He could make it.
0014_001108|The octopus has eight legs.
p299_146|There is too much at stake for that.
p263_228|We can hardly talk about it.
0018_001437|I think it'll encourage me.
0018_001244|Yes, I miss her.
0014_000785|Suppose I take grandmother a fresh vegetable.
0015_000840|What an impetuous boy he is!
p252_190|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
0018_001528|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!
p265_110|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p270_099|That time is not now, however.
p300_037|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p244_181|I was always in control.
p232_371|The scene is about this ?
0018_000461|We nightly dance our heyday guise.
p360_045|This will take up to nine months.
p246_170|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
0015_001640|Both side were softly curved.
p238_097|I was very pleased with them today, though.
0016_000597|She and i are running a neck and neck race.
p255_071|Ferguson should take note.
p297_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p330_279|It is always the same, isn't it?
en001_neutral_252|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p316_264|This is still happening in the US.
p239_266|He is not a pathetic figure.

p305_263|We can only go up.
0011_001567|I toy with my liqueur.
p244_118|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p277_047|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p269_156|That group reported just before Christmas.
p313_276|There have been different reports from different people.
p308_025|It does make a big difference.
p305_076|I'm so proud of my team.
0016_000293|He is old fashioned but he is the best of men.
p254_339|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p285_122|She really suffered for her art.
0017_000934|Hurry up, hurry up!
p262_239|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
0013_000094|They found a cow grazing in a field.
0012_000049|Then we all say aha!
0013_001207|Blackbird, and Jay.
p286_148|What happened in that game ?

p239_213|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
0011_000780|Then there was a report.
p304_201|The same goes for McKenna.
p340_029|But it's not just about that.
p302_058|We must improve our relations with the government.
p288_264|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
en001_enthusiastic_399|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
0012_000137|Let this glass globe be.
p339_103|We should not be surprised at that.
0016_000822|Am I an absolute pauper?
p250_460|It was like someone had died.
p326_245|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
0018_001434|A divine wrath made her blue eyes awful.
0015_001473|how suspicious this fox.
p282_042|Dancing was her life.
p248_366|It is legally binding.
0018_001300|Her kind and firm glance.
p270_257|I was just getting over the time difference.
p283_097|The trick is to try it.
p330_055|Scotland had great assets.
p343_231|It's always the same, isn't it?
p294_250|There are no excuses left for us.
p239_288|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
0020_001158|The squire himself showed perfect.
p330_143|That is the last thing they need.
0012_001625|Her existence makes him pleasant.
p341_403|She will just have wanted her baby.
p279_171|My life has been destroyed.
p361_188|This is positive and welcome.
0017_001379|And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.
p262_299|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
0012_000456|I guess it's a choice feast.
en002_enthusiastic_043|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p246_121|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p323_044|We've still got a say in this.
p270_448|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p278_035|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p263_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
0011_000185|The new born baby is stolen as we go.

p228_131|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p230_351|He is not very big, either.
p333_036|It's a policy which has worked for us.
en001_neutral_120|She's got to say something.
p276_418|A, The media has been great.
p302_284|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
0018_001276|And the next day. Nurse will be released.
p314_071|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
0016_001531|It must come sometimes to jam a day.
p260_064|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
0016_000517|I toy with my liqueur.

p341_112|I love this tournament.
p307_395|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
0013_000679|And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.
p314_081|It had a gigantic effect.
0017_001086|How I hate this foul pool!
p226_298|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p340_405|He said no survivors had been found.
p234_153|That is the nature of the game.
0014_001284|Hurry up, hurry up!
p238_375|And he goes with it.
p329_177|That is the first job of the director - leadership.

p288_218|We've got the bronze.
p237_173|He is keen to stay in public service.
0019_001591|I make her quite nervy at times.
p259_270|He was good, but not that good.)
p282_153|The weather forecast isn't good.
p310_323|The result today is an impasse.
p278_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p286_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p252_304|But there's also a love for the songs.
p334_235|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
p245_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p285_351|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p272_294|One was a lawyer.
p299_351|That's the last thing he will do.
p261_098|I had a ball today.
p284_091|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p233_186|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p299_056|I think it is a sensible change.

p374_274|He got very close tonight.
p312_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p277_448|The whole region is in shock.
p306_090|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p362_354|We are delighted with the result.
0012_001199|My winding sheet!
0011_001198|And on the top of them, came Winnie, the cute bear.
p300_114|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p253_223|It's not before time.
p253_408|It is legally binding.
p313_324|The referee had a shocking game.
p364_241|That is our business.
p252_266|Look at a computer.
p274_083|Our mother is very worried.)
p326_178|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p299_322|Soon the whole country will be level.
en002_enthusiastic_386|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p295_069|SO now we know the secret.
p226_056|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p292_131|It is a terrible loss.
0016_000523|He searched through the box.
p336_340|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
p329_252|I have no comment to make.
p236_099|Before the game we went for a pint.
0011_001542|Wake now my merry tads!
p280_268|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
0015_000295|I know how to obey orders.
p284_163|Seven people were later detained by police.
p286_286|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p285_394|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p281_111|They are at a very early stage.
p240_124|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p277_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p361_359|So far, it is no more.
p257_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p239_429|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
p282_293|One was a lawyer.
0012_001675|You shouldn't have pricked him with your horn.
0012_001057|I'm as bad as I can be.
0013_001253|I was not grabbed.
p300_386|Construction would then begin.
p313_175|It was that kind of night.
p269_382|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p246_055|It is unique.
p336_099|That statement has never been withdrawn.
0012_001668|He showed no signs of age.
p252_209|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p282_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
en003_angry_080|We put our bid in last night.
en006_neutral_230|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p343_045|So, it took me back to boarding school.
0018_001520|Our King George is labourers.
p277_417|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
0014_000498|And on the top of them, came Winnie, the cute bear.
0011_001126|The hag looked in the stove.
p234_185|He called for a public inquiry.
p277_370|I've never seen a game like it.
p303_173|We're all family men with children.
p280_125|I think there's not much between them.
p341_244|It was a big day.
p245_237|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p238_166|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p305_087|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p246_097|They make a selective perception process.
p299_230|I believe you may be that person.
p283_154|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
0015_000379|Rat came and replied on the leaves.
p262_050|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p273_430|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p286_317|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p303_299|And he had much need.
0011_001201|All the way to China is home.
p334_116|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p311_049|What would you do if you didn't work?
0020_001694|Now I understand.
p295_344|But you can go beyond that condition.
p259_195|But there's an upturn in the sector.)
0020_000353|That I owe my thanks to you.
0012_000539|When such wanderers meet.
p317_038|We see little sign of improvement.
p361_366|And that was just about that.
p288_360|However, it was well worth the wait.
0020_000253|I have a soothsayer.
p302_102|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
0017_000985|The straw, charcoal and the pea.
p284_233|The car was just there.
0020_000550|That cloth does not look worth much!
p263_100|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p288_204|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p326_392|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
0020_000081|And I never had a whooping cough why.
p237_344|The train was on time.
p362_135|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p295_185|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
en007_neutral_253|It was a total surprise.
p316_194|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p226_262|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p286_174|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p374_229|That is bad enough.
0016_000317|At length they came to a sharp bend.
p287_170|I am not ready to walk away.
p276_148|Are you from the rugby ?
p250_174|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
0013_000564|what are this thing, sticky!
0017_000445|Aha what I have we here?
en001_neutral_304|Kids are terrible.
p335_372|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
0015_000558|However, somebody killed something.
0011_000892|I have had to grow old.
0014_000215|He likes dragons very much.
0019_001217|I toy with my liqueur.
p275_105|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p363_222|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p329_107|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p271_206|Tommy is not a problem.
p326_315|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
p301_148|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p304_210|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p335_208|We don't say there was a massacre.
p295_079|It has to find out what went wrong.
p336_299|Relief was beyond belief.
p232_054|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p336_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p314_209|You saw the football.
p310_134|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p281_333|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
0014_000588|Today isn't an other day.
p243_104|They won't actually make any money from it.
p241_334|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p228_135|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
0020_000769|Not much use is it, sam?
p250_444|We know about the crisis in cattle.
0014_000686|Over them swooped the eagles.
p258_081|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p248_364|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p276_286|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p292_396|I'd rather have been playing.
p323_391|Later they changed their minds.
p250_350|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
0012_001123|how suspicious this fox.
p284_212|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p232_267|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
0014_000547|Fur flew through the air, teeth gnashed.
0012_001690|There goes the shawl again!
p284_084|They lived for their children.
0017_001094|Take courage all isn't lost yet.
0020_000395|The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs.
p272_191|We believe a third party was involved.
p276_131|Diversions were put in place.
p252_311|Many events are down on numbers.
p272_397|It will take place in July.
p238_409|How are you, sir ?
0017_000580|Your own wife is not at home.
p251_243|It is set in Paris.
p227_126|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
0012_000426|The hag looked in the stove.
p285_291|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p316_229|I waited and waited.
p271_371|It seems a long time ago.
p243_248|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
0019_000026|Let's make the noise like a snake.
p304_179|The real world is full of competing causes.
0018_000698|Dear customer,welcome to our ship.
0013_000614|Slam the doors and wedge them!
0019_001214|His large mouth curled into a sneer.
en001_neutral_172|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
0020_001327|The end part is fish mouth.
p263_368|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
0019_001545|Reed by the living pool!
p286_280|Is it in the right place ?
p259_232|Today we must not repeat that mistake.)
en006_angry_182|If not, he should go home.
0017_001260|It weighs seven point five kilogram.
p261_354|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
0014_000427|But I saw you walking.
p257_240|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
0011_000049|Then we all say aha!
0016_000520|But if you hadn't done them.
p282_140|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
en007_enthusiastic_268|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
p351_351|There was no basis for their arrest.
p362_068|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p264_169|I've no idea how it works.)
p292_192|Next time round, it will be different.
0018_000031|All smile were real and the happier the more sincere .
0018_001100|Rabbit gave dog a hurrying up sort of nudge.
p343_020|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
0015_000300|Six was half way down the room.
0013_000748|You are not a runaway,who are you?
p294_423|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p284_222|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p237_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p237_346|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p318_244|This was done by the council staff.
p330_245|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
0015_001364|Bob goes to a new school.
0014_001387|But mom I'm not certain about.
p300_159|They thought they had found a home.
0011_000310|Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin.
p307_070|When he took over it really took off.
p232_265|Blood samples were taken.
en006_neutral_353|I think the referee was good.
p245_314|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p361_163|That comes at a cost.
p326_127|I've beaten her a few times.
0019_000646|You woke me up!
p278_166|He is keen to stay in public service.
p302_025|It does make a big difference.
0014_000172|I shall say good bye.
p238_305|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p335_251|Who would have thought it?
p250_370|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p293_169|I just want to enjoy myself.
0017_001262|No thank you.
0012_001605|Fear neither root nor sprout!
0016_000614|Slam the doors and wedge them!
p285_155|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p364_051|There will be no disruption in the schools.
0015_000938|Today isn't any other day.
0014_001197|And there you'll find a snap dragon fly.
p351_069|The working families tax credit is far better.
0013_001263|Let it give us a chance, my precious.
p339_051|It means it is difficult.
p345_158|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p308_031|It has been blown out of all proportion.
0016_001467|I suppose no, it doesn't!
p227_109|You can spend money on housing.
p274_397|It's never great to finish second.)
p285_080|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p282_275|It's so awful.
p301_029|But we're not the same person.
p247_421|He seems to be used to the attention.)
p302_045|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
en002_neutral_009|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.

p236_088|How do you take them away ?
p228_039|She is believed to be in South Africa.
en001_neutral_357|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
0012_000340|So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight.
p374_074|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
0018_001407|I'm as bad as I can be.
p229_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
0012_001161|We nightly dance our heyday guise.
0019_001617|You cruelty shall cost your life !
p340_238|Is there any prospect of this happening?
en002_enthusiastic_368|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p311_312|We have not given up on the game.
p228_034|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p294_025|They were the better team on the night.
p270_146|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p292_153|Other forces were, however, at work.

en002_enthusiastic_229|He demanded to speak to the boss.
0019_001577|Tom fell with a cloven head.

p308_056|Henry was strong and talented.
p228_227|Clearly, the stakes are high.

p278_289|Those overseas offices were great.
p299_339|Barry will be able to handle this.

p248_170|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p225_289|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
en001_enthusiastic_244|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p227_051|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p362_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p277_159|They should come clean.
0019_001166|No, I burst the balloon!
p297_394|I ran to get out of the way.
en006_angry_386|We are not doing the Today programme.

p274_030|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.)
p329_390|It is a catalogue of obstruction.

p304_289|What are the barriers?
p313_399|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.

p293_366|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p249_149|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
en003_angry_246|However this weekend it will be different.
p261_071|Then followed a bout of flu.
0017_001580|Toast from the bread fruit tree.
p308_058|We must improve our relations with government.
p361_297|They went back to the seventeenth.
p314_401|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p301_364|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.

0014_000517|I toy with my liqueur.
p263_272|It seems a shame to leave it.

p282_145|I was awful.
p336_121|Why does it come out now?
p361_316|I'd never given up on myself.
en006_angry_142|The boy is no longer with us.
p330_201|We think all other measures are not exhausted.

p347_411|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p230_077|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p257_183|One was a lawyer.
p286_439|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
0018_001703|I am loath to see him go.
p244_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
0018_000173|He searched through the box.
p233_166|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
0012_000499|My winding sheet!
0019_000815|He might call it, for example.
0020_001185|I blinked my eyes hard.
0014_000482|I thank you for this mercy!
0012_001478|The art quite safe with me.
en002_enthusiastic_235|Or so he thought.
0012_001441|I chose the right way.
p243_380|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
0014_001533|I smell the breath of an English.
p254_234|It is not the message alone.
p374_351|I did not have a bet on myself.
p267_232|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p336_268|We're all going to take a holiday.
en006_neutral_216|It was that kind of match.
en002_neutral_155|It was by the numbers.
p301_116|The motive for the shooting was not known.
en007_enthusiastic_120|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
p310_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
0014_000454|Here i am whom you seek.
en002_enthusiastic_209|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p333_087|The Hague is too good for him.
p351_422|They have got off with murder.
p254_076|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p304_274|It's all going to clear the debt.
p326_121|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p268_025|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
0014_001174|You know, answers to the name of Tom's son.
0016_000972|No admittance except on party business.
p313_414|We never agreed to it.
en003_angry_113|But the next day she paid for it.
p301_380|It was a job he loved.
p287_286|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
en006_enthusiastic_185|The marshall at the turn was great.
p303_189|It is simple and easy to use.
0013_001046|I am going to go back home.
en001_angry_387|However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
0012_001733|You gain for nothing girl!
p294_346|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p275_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
0019_001141|We expected Tom would jump for joy.
p259_237|His third goal was superb.)
0017_000350|Do you have anything in mind?
p268_317|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
0020_000512|I lent george three pounds.
p227_222|They have known the hard times.
0013_000141|Can I lodge here tonight?
p264_332|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)
p301_142|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p317_039|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p273_030|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p303_245|She has a wonderful mind.
0015_000826|this turn goes to the hill.
en006_neutral_281|He loved the moment.
p335_104|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p340_167|It is clear that change is required.
p300_309|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p270_225|Does that put pressure on us ?
p276_082|So, did she meet him ?
p312_068|Who did the recruiting?
0012_000968|He showed no signs of age.
0011_000834|Rare rabbit had a little apron.
en007_enthusiastic_052|It is time for new ways for the church.

p231_231|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p250_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
0017_000926|And the next day. Nurse will be released.
0015_001569|Sam waved his arm vaguely.
p285_375|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
0014_001522|Am I an absolute pauper?
0012_000459|If they mother knew it.
p310_312|Both agreed on the success of the event.
0019_000069|Not much use is it, sam?
p229_252|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
0017_001670|Chew leaves quickly, said rabbit.
p341_076|But there was a shift.
p238_417|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p314_182|That's when you hope to take advantage.
0016_000531|First, issue a reward.
p311_210|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p267_412|My aim is a top six finish.
en006_neutral_395|The real enemy is in your own back yard.
0011_000981|He could not help doing so.
p270_131|What are they for ?
0013_000149|My winding sheet!
p255_176|You had to go and see him.
0013_001186|She has eaten the tapioca all of it.
0011_001423|I thought you meant how old are you?
p335_394|Partition is not an option.
p278_314|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p339_069|Services are being expanded, too.
p259_311|Frankly, we should all have such problems.)
p329_141|That is a job for the Government.
p243_353|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p364_205|It is so beautiful.
p254_193|The conference is the first test.
p339_153|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p340_241|Government funding is not a problem.
p288_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
0013_000688|Paul's teeth ached because of lemon.
p237_290|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p252_050|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p263_385|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p307_159|The death toll included five children.
p318_208|It was good to score the goal today.
p299_364|The surprise is its product is so poor.
0018_000299|His hope will cheat him.
p268_179|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p227_037|This represents a tough game for us.
p240_354|The composer will conduct.
p257_430|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
p260_269|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.

p271_081|Even the one she loved.
0018_001497|Confess that you opened the thirteenth door.
p225_237|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p267_205|It has been like that all year for me.
p347_151|I just wasn't very good.
0013_001303|I have a soothsayer.
0018_000987|A voice said: Come in.
0017_001429|Rat came and replied on the leaves.
p288_247|A friendship that will endure.
p243_286|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.

0011_001312|I believe you are one of them!
p304_419|I can understand why they have gone.
0011_000695|A whirring noise was heard.
0015_001436|How I hate this foul pool!
0012_001209|Such tunes are joy to a dancing fay.
p258_299|Graeme was prepared.
p276_113|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
en006_angry_332|We could soon be in that same position!
p361_325|There they were, making excuses for him.
0014_000799|I've hit the wrong nose.

p244_068|He has not been dropped.
0016_001464|And we are so thirsty!
p230_343|There was some merit in that.
p226_074|You need a trademark.

p361_164|And so did the rest of her team.
p281_310|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
0019_000176|She just smiled calmly, mother knows that is the best smile.

p277_206|In each case they were a goal down.
p330_151|They have worked with each other.

en002_angry_362|He is a quality player.
0012_001274|Do you know the lid opens?
0020_001015|It's how to say hi do you with Tom's answer.
p360_376|But everywhere the problems are the same.

p277_426|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
0016_000824|You know, answers to the name of Tom's son.

0019_000799|I've hit the wrong nose.
p329_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.

0015_000786|A tick a tack too.
p364_237|I am very encouraged by this poll.
0012_001412|Her shoes were like fishes.
p298_228|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p336_315|But he made a mistake in picking it.
p335_176|Laura is an investment banker.
0020_000266|We may join with that power.
p286_069|It wasn't possible to relax.
p246_142|I was awful.
p347_422|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
en001_angry_196|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p283_433|I would rather look at him.
p364_098|This is a one-off.
0011_000283|They had been named Tom and Jerry.
0020_001043|And what does it mean?
p277_316|Off with their heads.

p306_103|Housing is in very short supply.
0012_001521|Finn and the fairy shoemaker.

0020_000670|Goat Billy asked the old chinese guy.
0011_000674|And she caught at the brooch.
p333_159|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
en006_neutral_267|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
0020_001140|And they did push so!
p333_326|It's fantastic to have finally won.
0012_001117|I suppose no, it doesn't!
p229_132|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p280_038|He added that her comments were noted.

0020_000733|This used to be Jerry's occupation.
p230_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p227_396|It is a terrible equation.
p294_398|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.

p285_250|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p347_129|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
0017_000430|Then there was a report.
p305_073|I've put my own money into this project.
en003_angry_394|Chelsea was a great club.
p244_288|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
0018_000334|Another one, ten thousand dollars.
p271_329|It is a job creation scheme.
p340_290|It wasn't really like that at all.
0017_000955|This was the twenty fifth of november, seventeen eighty three.
en002_enthusiastic_106|Well, it won't.

p261_173|This is no reflection on Rangers.
en001_angry_090|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p245_288|The goals will come.
p295_032|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p259_417|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.)
p282_201|It's all about money, money, money.
0013_001620|Her paw went into your eye?
p304_372|It is the voice of the survivors.
p333_152|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
0019_000081|And I never had a whooping cough why.
p258_349|I got a yellow card.

p265_229|It's quite nice.
p280_128|We have to offer value for money.

p233_086|How are you, sir ?

p299_180|It's not in my nature.
p299_261|And we still have to pay his salary.
0017_000303|I am loath to see him go.
p292_346|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
0014_000680|She keeps saying I'm hers.
p265_297|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.

p264_432|The tie isn't over.)
en001_neutral_163|Nobody did in those days.

p329_032|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
0017_000171|I say neither yea nor nay.
en002_neutral_060|The answer was up there on the stage.
0013_001535|I blinked my eyes hard.
p311_279|I was shaking on the blocks.
p244_229|It still has an effect.

p286_411|I've had a wonderful career.

p257_080|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p244_047|The whole thing is the music.
p301_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p304_395|It was better than a soap opera.
0014_000859|Such tunes are joy to a dancing fay.
p262_169|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
0012_000797|Confess that you opened the thirteenth door.

p336_404|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
p298_204|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p245_179|The conference is the first test.
p241_204|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p292_423|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p265_306|I came into this world with nothing.
0013_000253|I have a soothsayer.
p225_195|It is hard to tell.
p314_072|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
0019_000001|The nine the eggs, I keep.
0015_001557|Blackbird, and Jay.
p264_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
p310_047|I hope you will leave it at that.
p276_247|That group reported just before Christmas.
p281_403|The casualties were not named.

p347_331|I am not changing my event.
0016_001290|Both side were softly curved.
0017_000080|Then there was a report.
0012_000662|Father has yellow eyes.
p264_206|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)
0015_001614|But what about this thing, sticky!
0011_000206|Still you owe it a duty.
0017_000913|Let it give us a chance, my precious.
0011_001221|I say neither yea nor nay.
p236_346|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p279_272|That could be in place by next year.
p229_295|These figures are truly awful.
en006_neutral_255|They need to be involved.
p240_067|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p276_147|We just have to adapt.
p271_368|The death rates are still as high.
p266_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312_246|You make the choice.
0020_000995|I know how to obey orders.
p258_175|I drove the ball well.
0015_000734|A divine wrath made her blue eyes awful.
p267_306|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p292_201|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p277_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p228_333|I've got no secret.
p374_264|But what did it matter?
p307_267|I do not own the vessel in question.
p333_400|Which means it matters.
0012_001429|Rat came and replied on the leaves.
p245_218|My wife and family are the support system.
p295_076|But then they scored their fourth.
0013_000122|Am I an absolute pauper?
p294_223|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
en002_angry_192|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p244_032|The end result is the same.
en006_neutral_320|This game is very evenly balanced.
p318_391|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p248_272|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p274_201|That might mean another delay.)
p333_067|I've taken to the hills.
p287_160|Phase one was a shambles.
p330_093|This will be great for the young lads.
p254_276|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
0015_000508|it looks much better.
p334_259|I am getting long in the tooth.
en007_neutral_282|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p241_239|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p271_334|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p334_075|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p225_295|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p277_186|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p361_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.

p243_086|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p329_203|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
0018_001091|I chose the right way.
p330_103|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p288_027|Is this accurate?
en002_enthusiastic_091|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
0016_000836|She has eaten the tapioca all of it.
p285_245|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
0018_001217|I toy with my liqueur.
p293_236|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
0019_001750|Do you have anything in mind?

0017_000198|I'd shoot myself. 
p279_182|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.

0015_000164|His large mouth curled into a sneer.
0013_000752|From August eighteenth, of their divorce.
p231_264|What was the matter for concern ?
p269_158|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p374_120|That's not going to happen again.
p245_160|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.

0020_001513|Mister lawson saw george last night.

p239_089|Had this been common practice ?
p307_310|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p336_375|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
p256_237|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p280_289|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
0020_000542|I have had to grow old.
0016_000952|I am run off my feet.
en001_enthusiastic_360|His views are hardly surprising.
p268_400|We have no information on Iraq.
p268_171|What was the matter for concern ?
p281_251|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p252_388|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p252_200|was everything done to save people ?
p333_416|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
0011_000214|But what about this thing, sticky!
0017_000114|A half pounds of flour and two ounces suet.
p314_339|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
0018_000259|The song is called Ways and Means.
p227_319|We have a clean bill of health.
p364_178|We want him to continue that way.
p284_327|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p286_464|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p314_051|I'm feeling pretty good.
0018_000558|However, somebody killed something.
p278_268|It is not enough to be first division champions.
0019_000384|A divine wrath made her blue eyes awful.
p234_127|However, it was a different story in the final.
p351_263|This is a dream come true for me.
p240_162|I was in the train station overnight.
0017_001487|A hippo lives in the zoo.
0019_001654|She laughed.
p267_359|We live on an island.
p225_285|We have to break that cycle.
p326_230|What is the point of jailing him?
p334_162|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
0011_000984|Chapter eighteen, the return journey.
p268_148|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p335_098|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p239_338|We used to live with dignity in our country.
0019_000162|I lent george three pounds.
p363_126|he announced his plans.
0019_000211|From each cake, there sprang a huge dog.
p250_128|That's not an assumption that I had made.
p304_383|I think we're going to make it.
p230_334|It was always an option.
p374_305|There have been different reports from different people.
0017_000652|Five hundred and one million right?
0012_000864|His large mouth curled into a sneer.
p334_067|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.

p252_207|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
0017_001540|What an impetuous boy he is!
p273_433|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p250_321|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p374_049|His condition was serious but stable.
en006_angry_180|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p257_221|She really suffered for her art.
p345_159|However, he did not stay there very long.
0016_000478|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!
p286_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p277_059|Here's a clue.
p374_358|It's for that reason he should resign.
p248_304|We have waited a long time for this.
p269_234|It's like a basketball.
p293_095|Her presence was almost everywhere.

0013_001004|How do you like you dirty bird!
p254_285|I saw it at a ruck.
p276_049|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
0020_001546|He said to Jack, the chatterer.
p311_220|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p283_149|Before it was an ordeal.
0019_001178|Put that rude grasshopper in jail!

p336_248|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.

p329_414|He was not seeking special advantage.
p287_240|He would not impose a fine.
p254_092|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p287_370|The members have voted against it.
p229_271|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p326_148|It's a difficult one to comment on.
en001_enthusiastic_197|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p228_113|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p281_048|That was the theory, anyway.

p341_236|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p245_044|But it took a lot of bottle.
p294_114|The industry will try to get round it.
p302_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
0013_001114|And we are so thirsty!
p230_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.

0019_000707|I'm as bad as I can be.
0012_001214|His large mouth curled into a sneer.
p340_207|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p257_190|We must keep our feet on the ground.

0012_001176|this turn goes to a hill.
p307_347|I just want to change my life.
p262_230|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?

0014_001339|No, said piggy carelessly.
0020_000730|Must a name mean something?
p341_389|Is this new report the answer?
p260_263|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p333_082|It runs until the beginning of June.
0011_001056|Andy what's the guy to gimble.
0013_000480|And would spoil my joke.
p374_090|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
0019_000301|I'm sure your friends can wait!
p341_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p248_312|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p283_170|Three hours later, the man was free.
p305_151|They just made me feel dizzy.
p246_172|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p336_204|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p302_207|Why should we even be asked to share?
p326_124|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p280_186|A great player has to win major championships.
p259_105|But they must believe in themselves.)
en007_neutral_331|That argument has been won.

p364_140|It won the match.
p264_375|We have a high quality product.)
p311_322|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p317_178|A lot of things can go wrong.
p282_276|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p251_043|Dancing was her life.
p333_291|It is just too long since the war.
en001_enthusiastic_272|Yet, it worked.
p270_306|Selection is not in my hands at all.
en001_neutral_279|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
0013_000717|Why has this egg not broken?
0014_001583|Fresh pain seized Paul's body.
p310_125|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p245_213|It was good fun.
0018_001011|I am safe back again.
p351_044|Who are the democrats?

p267_340|Do you think we are a top nation ?
p318_032|It was important to win the singles.
en001_angry_262|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.

p281_095|It is a vicious circle.
0014_001432|Who is been repeating all that hard stuff to you?
p249_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.

p316_223|They went back to the seventeenth.
p253_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.

p297_052|All will be revealed in due course.
p301_082|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p254_335|It should be a great game, though.
0012_000963|She said in subdued voice.
p273_328|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
0015_000628|I know you .

p248_178|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
0013_000142|Wake now my merry tads!

0020_000050|Rabbit gave dog a hurrying up sort of nudge.
0016_000289|No, said piggy carelessly.
p256_289|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p343_090|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.

p245_104|I'm delighted about that.
p334_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p277_249|This is the first step.
p330_275|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p275_185|His name was unknown.
p301_056|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
0018_001324|Because he was a man with infinite resource and sagacity.

p326_291|That's my big challenge.
p329_407|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p314_374|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
p241_368|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p283_443|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
p255_371|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p273_289|It's all designed to speed up the service.

0015_000151|All the way to China is home.
en003_angry_349|They're appalled by that.
0016_001729|And his heart wagged with joy like a lamb's tail.
p308_008|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p335_152|The elections should have no role in this.
p340_332|People are using it in their daily lives.
p225_239|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p247_181|I always felt they played for me.)
p245_136|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
0020_001367|At length they came to a sharp bend.
p232_149|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p228_110|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.

p230_084|You are a great player.
p343_168|He can do no wrong.

p252_062|For a decade she was proved right.
p293_154|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
0018_000562|No thank you.

p316_405|I am glad that justice has been done.
0016_000612|I believe you are one of them!
p237_130|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p240_377|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p230_102|This was a good move for me.
p288_089|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p261_250|It is now the big brother.
p292_301|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p330_371|That's the law of the land.
0015_000961|After a while he perceived both giants.
p272_165|I've put my own money into this project.
0018_000484|Rare rabbit had a little apron.

0016_000177|Tom fell with a cloven head.
p347_397|It is not a wish list.
p314_174|I was never alone with her, right?

en002_neutral_296|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p335_340|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p330_351|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p240_137|He was in a great deal of pain.
0017_001666|We may join with that power.
p241_082|I first met him last summer.
p316_150|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
p231_465|She has now been registered as disabled.
p299_119|I am happy with my form.
p250_446|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.

p265_341|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p283_379|He was then replaced by Ross.
p308_307|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p313_115|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p248_284|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.

p267_059|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p302_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.

p270_267|It is probably in the culture.
p284_372|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p282_110|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p284_194|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p361_220|It is an outrage.
p362_273|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p283_118|There were no grounds for his action.
p363_035|I think it is wide open.
p310_363|I love the moment of being first.
p299_279|It has, however, been a long time coming.
0014_000955|This was the twenty fifth of november, seventeen eighty three.

0019_000138|But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.
0015_001529|A large flat ferry boat was moored beside it.
p247_345|Is there a waiting list ?)
p306_037|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p326_039|There is nothing like this back home.
p262_291|Who did the recruiting?
p297_396|It's not a party, no, no.

p282_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.

p292_081|I can't believe she is dead.
p374_290|He's very good at relating to adults.
0017_001606|Still you owe it a duty.
p339_150|Mind you, all was not lost.
p267_327|You are looking at him.
p306_108|You either have him or you don't.
p343_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p229_181|Does that put pressure on us ?
0015_001658|Mum shuts one's mouth up, doesn't it.
p247_288|None of this work is guaranteed.)
p335_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
en003_angry_045|We will be victorious.
0015_001082|Who is been repeating all that hard stuff to you?

p273_345|There was a definite prejudice.
0012_000717|Why has this egg not broken?
p262_286|The attacker died in the crash.
p253_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p292_422|We didn't get any from his face.
p241_140|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p363_047|This has come as a shock to everyone.
0017_001232|Age forty five if a day a lie.
p310_101|Construction is due to begin in February.
p311_294|So there is a very real dilemma.
p304_110|I am just going to go for it.
0017_001276|And the next day. Nurse will be released.
p233_135|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p253_331|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
en007_enthusiastic_211|The capital costs are modest.
en007_enthusiastic_035|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p227_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p230_196|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
en001_neutral_258|They are never here.
0016_000269|But show me how your map!
p277_300|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p260_100|May not have been at fault?
p283_293|None of the agencies was able to help.
p238_229|That view has not altered.
en001_neutral_031|This is the window.
p253_371|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p234_108|In London today, it was business as usual.
0019_000803|The elephant and the carpenter is the longest.
p323_266|I was not happy about being left out.
0020_001296|We can not do it sir.
p314_367|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p303_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p295_197|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
0017_000073|how suspicious this fox.
0013_000973|I'd just as soon swim your way as others do.
en002_enthusiastic_032|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p317_142|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
0018_001565|They were going fast, with a light clip.
p341_266|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p345_293|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.

p283_065|I expect a rapid response.
p305_413|We suspect he was pleased.
p300_291|It's not even finished.
p308_361|They have not let anyone into the loop.
p360_098|The release attracted little attention.

0018_000131|It must come sometimes to jam a day.
p301_295|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p283_386|I believe the gap is nearly there.
0020_001117|I suppose no, it doesn't!
p329_027|It's not a solo.
0012_000125|To catch that bulrush root with my paw!
p364_284|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.

p374_154|Next league matches Motherwell.
p330_197|Billie was yet to be born.
p262_246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.

p250_299|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.

p239_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.

p303_141|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p303_266|There is no such thing.
p280_318|I always felt they played for me.

p276_239|What do they want us to do ?
p362_213|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p237_091|Today I couldn't run on it.

p253_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
